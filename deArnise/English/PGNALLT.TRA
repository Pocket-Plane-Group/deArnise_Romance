@0    = ~I can't stop thinking that my home will never be the same. So many of the people I knew are dead, the keep was turned inside out, and my father...~ [PGNALI00]
@1    = ~But then I think of those who never had homes so grand or fathers so kind and I wonder if I am not simply being foolish.~ [PGNALI01]
@2    = ~We will rebuild it, Nalia. It will not be the same, but it can still be your home.~
@3    = ~Yes, you are, you spoiled brat.~
@4    = ~You are right. After you bury your father, things are never the same.~
@5    = ~Take it from me. Home is where you find it. Cast off your foolish ideals of castles and ballrooms and lace and live for the road.~
@6    = ~Hmph. I was merely thinking aloud, <CHARNAME>. I did not expect such backlash.~
@7    = ~And still, my father has not even been properly laid to rest yet!~
@8    = ~I have for some time, <CHARNAME>. As much as I sometimes miss the stifling comforts of home, I know that my real home must be where the needy suffer the most.~
@9    = ~As much as I wished to distance myself from the suffocating attitudes and petty squabbling of the nobility which my father was sometimes dragged into, I never hoped to leave him behind like this.~
@10   = ~Oh, I know. The servants will see to that, with our guidance. But my father often said that the Keep was just a thing... a place. He was the one who made it what it was. Without him, I don't know what it will be.~
@11   = ~I know it would have been my father's wish to... to die while defending his lands, his family, and the attendants and peasants who admired him so over the years.~
@12   = ~It has not been easy knowing that getting back to the Keep just a day or two earlier might have saved him, and many others.~
@13   = ~I wish I could have met your father. He seemed like an interesting man, and he sired a beautiful daughter.~
@14   = ~Don't try to blame his death on me! We went there as fast as we could, it is not my fault you did not find me sooner!~
@15   = ~I think we did quite well, Nalia, considering the lack of planning time and the opposition.~
@16   = ~They bought the time we needed. We will remember their sacrifice, and move on.~
@17   = ~Might I have earned a greater reward if he was still alive?~
@18   = ~What? How dare you ask me a question like that? I should certainly hope not!~
@19   = ~I know, <CHARNAME>. I do not fault your tactics.~
@20   = ~Why... yes, <CHARNAME>, he was. An interesting man. I wish he were still with us, but I know that we did the best we could.~
@21   = ~Of course, <CHARNAME>. I will not soon forget anything about that terrible day.~
@22   = ~What? No, of course not.~
@23   = ~We prevented the catastrophe that would have followed if those beasts roamed our lands. My father and those soldiers died as much to fight the brutes as to keep them contained in the Keep, I am sure of it. So many would have been killed, or gone homeless and hungry... it would have been a terrible legacy for my father's name.~
@24   = ~I am sorry for being so morbid, <CHARNAME>. I am sure I will feel somewhat better when my father's funeral arrangements have finally been made. We should carry on.~
@25   = ~You were not obligated to accompany me to my father’s funeral. Most people don’t like to be reminded of death. Why did you come?~ [PGNALI02]
@26   = ~I wanted to pay my respects to a good man.~
@27   = ~I was heading that way anyway. I enjoy visiting graveyards.~
@28   = ~You looked like you needed a friend, and I stand by my friends in tough times.~
@29   = ~I wanted to see if you would cry. You really disappointed me, I wanted waterworks.~
@30   = ~Now I know what kind of man you truly are. Hmph. I will expect you to be better behaved when it comes to running my father's Keep.~
@31   = ~Oh. I see. Well.~
@32   = ~I suppose one should not be judgmental of another's... hobbies.~
@33   = ~I appreciate that, <CHARNAME>. Perhaps I can return the favor when you are in need someday.~
@34   = ~That is a very thoughtful gesture for a man I am certain you never met.~
@35   = ~It still makes me fume with rage that Isaea was there to press his ridiculous claim on me! Everyone else was willing to put aside the differences they had with my father--and there were plenty of differences to set aside--but not Isaea.~
@36   = ~I know exactly what he's after, and it has nothing to do with me or what I want from MY life. He just wants to build his own empire on my father's hard work and turn me into some helpless, homebound, frilly gown-wearing socialite!~
@37   = ~I have no intention of being that person for him or for anyone else! There are far too many who need my aid!~
@38   = ~All this would be far simpler if he were to meet with an unfortunate accident. I could certainly arrange one.~
@39   = ~Are you certain? Isaea looks like the type of man who could put you in your place in a hurry.~
@40   = ~Why not simply tell him your heart is set on another? I could name a likely candidate.~
@41   = ~Oh, right. Those "needy" you keep going on about, is it?~
@42   = ~I heard you, there is no need to shout.~
@43   = ~Hah. THAT will be the day. I would sooner muck Isaea's stalls than warm his bed, but both are distasteful ideas.~
@44   = ~I am sorry if my resolve frightens you, <CHARNAME>, but my father encouraged me to put my heart into whatever it is I wanted to do, not to settle for half-measures. I promised myself that I would live by that advice.~
@45   = ~No, that wouldn't help at all. Thanks to the usual cronyism and incompetence that plagues the upper echelons of society, Isaea is very well positioned in the Athkatlan guard. Harming him would draw a lot of attention, and we would be in the wrong.~
@46   = ~Besides, there has been enough killing and dying over land and castles to last me a lifetime. If I must kill, I want it to be for change that means something to people, not just over banners on a rampart.~
@47   = ~While I'm certainly not opposed to lying to a wretch such as Isaea, I would prefer to maintain the moral high ground in this. Besides, he would simply rant and rave that it was a violation of the "contract" my father agreed to that he knows full well isn't worth the paper it was written on any longer. It would solve nothing.~
@48   = ~Absolutely. Few people are willing to take their plight as serious as I, so few are even qualified to give them the help they need, to say nothing of whether or not they actually feel responsible enough to act.~
@49   = ~I am trying to put this whole episode behind me, and get back to finding ways to rescue the downtrodden. Lead the way, <CHARNAME>. I will follow.~
@50   = ~Burying my father was hard enough without Isaea's scheming making it worse. I would like to remember my father in peace... excuse me.~
@51   = ~I dreamed of home last night. Home before the trolls came, that is. It felt very strange to see the Keep as I remember it, and to see my father, hard at work as always.~ [PGNALI03]
@52   = ~I know it is not real, not any more. My father is gone, but my home, and indeed what he stood for his whole life, remain, and I consider myself quite fortunate.~ [PGNALI04]
@53   = ~Which brings me to you, <CHARNAME>. I did not think until now to ask how it makes you feel to be so far from your home.~ [PGNALI05]
@54   = ~I have never truly known a home. I lived in Candlekeep, but I could not say I belonged there.~
@55   = ~Do not disturb me. I am thinking.~
@56   = ~Leaving Candlekeep against my will was the most painful thing I have ever done.~
@57   = ~It matters little. I need to track down Irenicus far more than I need the comfort of my own bed.~
@58   = ~Oh, not so terrible. I know we can visit the Keep any time, after all.~
@59   = ~Life goes on whether or not I am happy where I am. I mean to make a quick exit from Amn once my business with Irenicus is concluded. Maybe I will find a home, maybe not.~
@60   = ~Very well. I'll not intrude upon your thoughts.~
@61   = ~How unfortunate! I would have thought it a fascinating place, although certainly one needs to get away once in a while and see the rest of the world.~
@62   = ~How unfortunate! The trolls drove me from my home, of course, but it was not nearly the same situation, and I am not so far from home.~
@63   = ~How very driven you are. It takes great sacrifice to put those material things behind you and focus on the greater good, I know.~
@64   = ~The Keep...? Well, yes, I suppose that is your home now, <CHARNAME>, in a manner of speaking of course, but I think we should remember that the real goal here is to prevent it from falling into the hands of the Roenalls.~
@65   = ~That sounds like the view of a pragmatist. Pragmatism is a fine thing, <CHARNAME>, but I have seen that too often it gets in the way of compassion. If you cannot care about yourself, how can you care about the plight of others?~
@66   = ~I can only hope that we do well by my father's wishes, so that the Keep is even greater than what I see in my dreams. The people of our lands are accustomed to working hard for fair treatment, I have no doubt they will follow our lead.~
@67   = ~I must remember that my home is their home, and their home is mine, and that the decisions we make affect each and every one of them.~
@68   = ~I don't want anyone's dreams of home to be better than the realities of home.~
@69   = ~Nalia, relax. You have said yourself that you have good people managing the affairs.~
@70   = ~"Your home is their home"? You do not really believe that, do you?~
@71   = ~Life is hard. I would expect your peasants to know that better than most.~
@72   = ~That sounds very sweet. I hope you can make it possible.~
@73   = ~Yes, I know. Responsibility is powerful, <CHARNAME>. There was a time not long ago that I took those things for granted, but now that it is my responsibility, my legacy, I find myself less willing to trust that others will act as I would.~
@74   = ~And I have great hopes for what we can accomplish.~
@75   = ~Of course I do. That does not mean I would just throw open the drawbridge to all and sundry while I take up residence in a cottage--that would be chaos!~
@76   = ~It is simply a question of respect and consideration. Those are the first steps to equality, after all.~
@77   = ~Scoff if you must, <CHARNAME>, but my father always worked to ensure that the people who swore fealty to him were treated well, and treated as people rather than as serfs. And I will see to it that we continue to do so, so that we can come closer to real equality.~
@78   = ~I take my responsibility very seriously. I won't pretend it is easy to change the way social classes think of each other, but it simply must be done.~
@79   = ~This has been a welcome change, having someone to travel with.~ [PGNALI06]
@80   = ~I cringe to think what Aunty would say if she knew I was a member of a full-fledged adventuring company. Actually, I am sure she is preparing a lecture even now in case the opportunity ever presents itself. She is not very understanding of what the less-fortunate are forced to do to earn a living, you see.~
@81   = ~Even though it is just you and I, that is still one more person than I normally have accompanying me. And Aunty would be positively scandalized if she knew that it was just you and me! She's very old fashioned about interactions between men and women, you see.~
@82   = ~I don't want to imagine how simply dreadful I would have felt, being lonely at a time like this. It has been... quite civil of you to retain me in your company.~
@83   = ~Well, truthfully, I need your skills until we can rescue Imoen. After that, you will be out on the street.~
@84   = ~We are not "forced" to do anything, Nalia. I could hold any profession I wish, but right now I have a duty to rescue Imoen.~
@85   = ~We are not "forced" to do anything, Nalia. I could hold any profession I wish, but right now I have a special responsibility to settle the score with Irenicus.~
@86   = ~And what do you think she would have to say about one man and one woman keeping such close quarters?~
@87   = ~Nonsense. I travel with you because I enjoy having you near me.~
@88   = ~That is simply the sort of fellow I am. Quite civil.~
@89   = ~I thought you more independent than that. Solitude bothers you, does it?~
@90   = ~Things will stay more civil if you keep your place and speak only when spoken to.~
@91   = ~Pardon the interruption, <CHARNAME>, it certainly was... unintended.~
@92   = ~Very well. If that's how you like things to be in your company, I will honor your wishes and not waste your time with idle chit-chat.~
@93   = ~If that is what shall be most convenient for you I am sure it is the way you will have it. You will not find me crying over your decision when it comes. I will simply have more time to be more active improving the plight of the downtrodden.~
@94   = ~Oh, I can only imagine. It was different with the servants, for she was quite confident they knew their place. But we know that she is far less certain or enthusiastic about you. I'm sure it would be quite bombastic, and nothing you or I would want to lend any credence to by granting her an audience anyway.~
@95   = ~You needn't resort to flattery to keep my loyalty, <CHARNAME>. I value actions far more than words, and I'm still confident your actions will take us down the charitable course.~
@96   = ~Ha! Careful now, <CHARNAME>. I would hate to be forced to tell the social registrar what a cad you've become in just a short time as Lord of the keep!~
@97   = ~Oh, if only that were true, <CHARNAME>! But even the trade classes can be so detestable in their inequities. If you haven't apprenticed yourself to the right master, acting as a virtual bond-slave, you'll never get any sort of standing in the guilds, and without that, where would you be?~
@98   = ~No, I am certainly quite comfortable with independence--something Aunty has railed about at great length on more than one occasion.~
@99   = ~I never considered my home life incomplete for lack of siblings. It spared my family the petty squabbles over succession and title that plague so many so-called noble households, and allowed us to live in peace and mutual respect.~
@100  = ~But to think that I am now the only person alive to have known my mother and father AS mother and father is a tremendous responsibility, and a terribly lonely feeling. I wish now, perhaps for the first time, that there had been another to share this with me.~
@101  = ~Of course, Aunty knew them both and was a great comfort to me when Mother died, but she was only blood to my father and, between you and me, I believe she always regarded him more as lord than kin.~
@102  = ~Forgive my indulgence, <CHARNAME>. You are a good listener if nothing else, and I am grateful for your attention. It means a great deal to me as I evaluate this unexpected twist in my life. For the good of the de'Arnise estate and my own sanity, I am quite pleased to retain your acquaintance.~
@103  = ~Just "acquaintance"? Nalia, great alliances have been forged for far less important goals than the one that brought us together.~
@104  = ~It is my pleasure to serve, however you need me.~
@105  = ~If you think I have been listening, your sanity is clearly in question.~
@106  = ~I could have wished for a true sibling as well, but Imoen was as good as any sister could have been, I am sure.~
@107  = ~Trust me, you are right about the siblings. Imoen thought she was my sister and she was a real pain in the neck.~
@108  = ~Perhaps we can set her and Aunty in the same room and rid ourselves of two problems at once, then!~
@109  = ~I hope she is quite safe, <CHARNAME>. I would never suggest you mistake the Cowled Wizards for gracious hosts.~
@110  = ~But, come. We shall do no good for her or anyone else just standing around.~
@111  = ~With the major domo's professional experience and my conscience guiding you, I am certain we will meet my father's expectations, and maybe even exceed them. Although I worry about what the Roenalls will do when they come to realize how we have bested them.~
@112  = ~It is most fortunate that our quick thinking took root before they could.~
@113  = ~You must admit, <CHARNAME>, the Copper Coronet is a most improper place for the forging of great alliances. But I have always been one to break with tradition.~
@114  = ~Let them remember our fateful meeting over the siege of my Keep as the dawning of a new era in Amn, for all I care. So long as we stay true to ourselves and do right by the people who rely on us.~
@115  = ~Obviously I gave you far more credit than you deserved.~
@116  = ~It's certainly high time you called for a rest! I feel as though my arms and legs are about to fall off! I couldn't lift a sword or a scroll if my life depended on it!~ [PGNALI09]
@117  = ~I would like to see the look on--ouch, and how did THAT get in my boot?--on my tutor's face when he saw me now. "Nalia," he would say, "you've stamina but no drive, not when it counts."~
@118  = ~Not that he didn't know better, but he enjoyed saying it. Anyway, I am quite certain that even he would agree that today, it counted. On all ten of my toes. If I still have them, that is.~
@119  = ~Some tutor got out of line with you? I would have had him flogged. I still may.~
@120  = ~Your stories do not interest me, Nalia. Kindly go to sleep and leave me be.~
@121  = ~What are you talking about? I am tired and have no head for word games and allusion right now.~
@122  = ~What a foolish thing for him to say. You are an extremely driven individual, and it shows in everything you do.~
@123  = ~You can't take a little light exercise? How disappointing.~
@124  = ~I was merely speaking of my exhaustion, and my thoughts strayed to my mentor.~
@125  = ~Light?!? Oh, you are clearly a man after Burwood's own cranky heart.~
@126  = ~At the end of a day such as this, it is a great relief to hear that somebody understands me. Burwood always pretended not to, although I am certain it was only an act.~
@127  = ~Now, <CHARNAME>, there's no call for that. Besides, I wouldn't know exactly where to find him. And he would probably disappear in a puff of smoke before you got within 20 feet of him with a whip.~
@128  = ~Well, I only wanted to spend a few moments in civilized conversation. I see no need to start yet another fight.~
@129  = ~How I miss old Burwood. He never did afford me the courtesy of being able to wish him a proper farewell.~
@130  = ~He was my tutor in the arcane, and took it upon himself to tell me everything he thought about how the world should work. There wasn't an organization small enough that he would not rather cut in half, or a rule he would not prefer to remove every other word from, and then toss out the other half for good measure.~
@131  = ~He sounds like your sort of fellow, then. Changing the rules to suit himself.~
@132  = ~Sounds like a self-centered bore.~
@133  = ~You had a magic tutor? That was allowed in a noble household?~
@134  = ~Oh, not at all. He simply didn't believe that anyone knew how he should live his life better than himself.~
@135  = ~Oh, yes. We got along quite well. That is, when he wasn't incessantly teasing me for saying things that I knew he believed himself.~
@136  = ~It would hardly be the first choice for some of the more proper and cloistered noble daughters of the world but it was the right one for me.~
@137  = ~You see, <CHARNAME>, when Aunty decided that she had had enough of my penchant for picking the lock of every door in the keep before breakfast, she demanded that Father do something about it. I insisted that there was nothing wrong with learning to scout and infiltrate, but Aunty just grew more and more livid. She scoffed when I told her how useful developing those talents had been for reaching the people who so desperately needed charity, and her face was positively priceless when I told her where I had hidden the diary I plucked right out from under her nose... she never saw me!~
@138  = ~As I was saying, Father eventually knew that Delcia would not be silenced in this and he spoke to me very much as an equal and asked me to compromise. I said that I would agree to suspend my study of the sneaksman's trade if I were allowed to pursue whatever else I wanted, including my work with the needy. I told him that I wanted to know everything there was to know about spellcraft.~
@139  = ~Father always said that things should be done in full measure, with wholehearted commitment or not at all, so he agreed to spare no expense or inconvenience and found a tutor for my studies.~
@140  = ~I still remember when Burwood came and presented what he claimed were his Cowled Wizard credentials--which he promptly burned to a crisp with a word and a gesture. "Young lady, the study of magic is not something done with someone looking over your shoulder. It is something you do to knock the chip off someone else's shoulder," he said to me in my first lesson.~
@141  = ~He was forever criticizing me to get me to work harder. It was a game he played, I suppose. I came to appreciate it, although his sense of humor was certainly rather... off-color.~
@142  = ~That all seems so long ago. I have not needed his help much in recent months, as I get plenty of practice from the underground scroll shops in Athkatla, but he had been at the Keep as recently as last season. Then he left saying he had brief business to attend to in the city, and then we received a message from him stating that he had found new long-term employ and would not be returning to the Keep. I should have liked to wish him well, but he was always unpredictable.~
@143  = ~Zzzzzzzzz... ~
@144  = ~So your point was, he did not think much of your dedication?~
@145  = ~That was very clever, getting your father to fund your study of magic. You are quite talented.~
@146  = ~Perhaps he just found better pay.~
@147  = ~Such fondness for an old master. I could not get away from my teachers fast enough. Or did you have some deeper relationship with this man?~
@148  = ~I don't want you to think that I somehow exploited my father's affection or his coffers for my own gain, <CHARNAME>. I simply was not going to allow Aunty to make me into... well, into her!~
@149  = ~Oh. I seem to have talked you to sleep, <CHARNAME>. And if you will excuse me, I will rest my weary head as well.~
@150  = ~I very much doubt that. Burwood was not the sort of man to be motivated by a few extra coins. He probably just got distracted by something shiny. Ha!~
@151  = ~Oh, don't worry, <CHARNAME>. He would laugh if he heard me say that.~
@152  = ~Heavens, no! The mere thought... anyway, Burwood was simply a good friend and a good instructor and I think it is important that our mentors know that they are appreciated. Perhaps I will earn the same respect from those I aid someday.~
@153  = ~Not that he would ever admit. But that was his way. He always wanted me to remember that there would always be someone better than me, someone willing to stay up an hour later or run up a hill I was too tired to climb.~
@154  = ~My, I feel lightheaded. I suppose my stamina is not quite limitless. Good night, <CHARNAME>.~
@155  = ~Unnnhhh... no! Leave this place...~ [PGNALI13]
@156  = ~I'll... I'll KILL YOU!~ [PGNALI14]
@157  = ~No! No! Come back here! Fa... Father!~ [PGNALI15]
@158  = ~FATHER!!!!!~ [PGNALI16]
@159  = ~Nalia! Nalia, wake up!~
@160  = ~Stand back, rogues, or I will... what is going on? Where are our foes?~
@161  = ~I'll kill you if you don't stop that yelling!~
@162  = ~Shhh... shhh... Nalia, you are having a nightmare. Everything is all right.~
@163  = ~No--no! Don't touch me!~
@164  = ~Wh-what? No... no! I can't leave him!~
@165  = ~I'll... I...~
@166  = ~Oh... oh.~
@167  = ~(sigh) My... my apologies, <CHARNAME>. I fear my dreams have been rather intense lately. Our... my failure to save my father has been weighing on me rather heavily.~
@168  = ~The dreams are becoming quite cruel, actually. When this started, I was only reliving those last moments in the cellars, and of finding my father's body.~
@169  = ~But now, he is alive. Tor'Gal is keeping him prisoner, threatening to kill him if we come any closer. And I can't stop myself from going to him, I have to save him, and then... I get closer and closer every night, <CHARNAME>, but the troll cuts him down before I can reach him.~
@170  = ~Nonsense. It is all nonsense. My father is dead, and so is that beast. It is my duty to live with this and continue to see to the needs of others. I think it's very ironic that I can do that much easier while I am awake than when I sleep.~
@171  = ~Having some bad dreams for a while is normal. I had nightmares about Gorion for weeks.~
@172  = ~Maybe it is because his real killer has not paid the price for his crimes. We still do not know who sent those creatures to overrun your lands.~
@173  = ~Keep your mind on the tasks at hand, Nalia, and soon you will be back to your normal self.~
@174  = ~You would think you were the only person around here with problems. Keep it to yourself, and if you wake me up like that again, you will have your arm in a sling for a week.~
@175  = ~Oh, Nalia. Is there anything I can do?~
@176  = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>. I suppose it IS quite common to feel this way. I am just not accustomed to such weakness. "Mind over matter," though, isn't that what they say? Perhaps I will learn to control these dreams better.~
@177  = ~No. Obviously Tor'Gal was working at someone else's behest, but we shan't solve that mystery through my dreams, I am afraid. Were my slumber more prophetic, I am sure the entire tragedy would have been avoided.~
@178  = ~Yes, I am sure you are quite right. Perhaps the smile on a poor little girl's face today will wipe these horrible images from my head.~
@179  = ~Nothing more than you already have, <CHARNAME>. I... I am glad I woke to a friendlier face than Tor'Gal's.~
@180  = ~Then I shall certainly not come to YOUR aid as you thrash and scuffle in your nightmares!~
@181  = ~Thank you for checking on me. I will be fine. The things I see in my dreams are no more real with repetition. Mind over matter.~
@182  = ~Let us be on our way. I shall try to think of brighter things as I go to sleep this eve.~
@183  = ~First the keep, then my father’s funeral, now Isaea’s detestable plotting... I thought I was supposed to be helping people, but it appears I constantly need you to come to my aid.~ [PGNALI17]
@184  = ~Yes. I know.~
@185  = ~My pleasure. I can never resist a damsel in distress.~
@186  = ~Honestly, I would have thought you might have managed an escape by yourself.~
@187  = ~He made it personal. I will never stand by while a member of my company is harmed.~
@188  = ~Yes, and this time will cost you, too. You already gave me lordship of the keep, what is your freedom worth to you?~
@189  = ~You're... not serious, are you? I know my skills are valuable to you, but the arrangement for the Keep CAN be undone, <CHARNAME>. Please tell me that this was just an ill-timed attempt at humor.~
@190  = ~Hah. Who will you get to run the Keep without me? Isaea? I call your bluff, silly girl.~
@191  = ~Of course. See? We laugh. Ha, ha.~
@192  = ~My standard fee for rescuing women is 250 gold. I would hate to have to tell people you do not honor your debts.~
@193  = ~I suppose I can content myself with a hearty handshake.~
@194  = ~I cannot believe what I'm hearing! Something WILL be done about this. All this betrayal, I simply do NOT understand.~
@195  = ~Oh, Hades take you and your greed.~
@196  = ~Here. Enjoy its cold comfort.~
@197  = ~Just so, <CHARNAME>. Thank you once more. I am very relieved to be back in more civilized company.~
@198  = ~Er, yes, <CHARNAME>. I'm sorry, I'm still out of sorts from this whole experience.~
@199  = ~Yes, well, there is no cause to be so short with me, <CHARNAME>. I have simply found myself in some difficult situations as of late.~
@200  = ~Well, I would hope to be a little more self-sufficient than that. It is not as though I waved a lace handkerchief out a window to summon you. Although I am relieved you got the message, regardless.~
@201  = ~It was not for lack of trying, <CHARNAME>.~
@202  = ~A mistake I am certain he will not soon repeat.~
@203  = ~It was all rather unusual, being Isaea's prisoner. I thought he would be there to gloat, or perhaps arrive with some drunken priest to force a marriage, but he seemed preoccupied and was rarely around. Whether that was to see to his reprehensible business dealings or to try to cover them up once he heard you were looking into them, I cannot say.~
@204  = ~That was certainly no military stockade he had me locked up in. It was probably one of his safe houses, which was why they hooded me to keep me from seeing where I was being taken. Quaint, if rather dingy. I was locked in a small room, with precious few clues as to where I might be. Somewhere in the city, since it did not take overlong to reach you once you turned the tables.~
@205  = ~They--Isaea and his social-climbing goons--kept me well away from my spellbook, of course, so blasting my way out was simply out of the question. I think Isaea set me up for a laugh, however. The first room they kept me in had an insultingly weak lock on it, but once I picked that it let me out to a small hallway with a guarded and barred door. And the guards were not good company. There was another man who came by occasionally, a mage, but I never got a good look at him.~
@206  = ~Now that I think of it, I do not think Isaea spoke more than a few words to me once he made that great show of incarcerating me for my own protection. He just asked me if I was comfortable and "begged" me to reconsider my refusal to have anything to do with him. My answer was always the same.~
@207  = ~Listening to the conversations through the door, I heard a little in the way of detail about the seedier parts of Isaea's dealings, but probably nothing you do not already know for yourself.~
@208  = ~But that's behind us, and Isaea is probably quaking in his boots over his impending tribunal. Perhaps we should attend? I'm sure he will make quite the scene.~
@209  = ~He would probably just use his scabby influence to try to have us put in irons in his place. No thank you.~
@210  = ~Isaea didn't... hurt you in any way, did he?~
@211  = ~I will be the first to call for his head!~
@212  = ~All that matters to me is that you are safe. I missed you terribly.~
@213  = ~I must admit that I would have preferred almost anywhere to another day in Isaea's dank closet. But returning to the company of someone so thoughtful means a great deal to me. I... I had hoped you would come.~
@214  = ~That is, I thought--um, I thought it would be best for our partnership. Which we should continue to pursue with all haste. Lead on, <CHARNAME>.~
@215  = ~He may try, but knowing Isaea, I would say he's out of tricks. Axehand is a good man, and now that he sees what Isaea is, I doubt he will let him get away.~
@216  = ~He has certainly found ways to drain even my charitable spirit.~
@217  = ~Well, once they put that hood over my head I picked up a few bumps and bruises, mostly from knocking into things. None of the marks are permanent. And Isaea did nothing untoward, although your gallant concern is noted and appreciated.~
@218  = ~I do think he's afraid of you, however. He mentioned you--by name, which surprised me--and mentioned that he would be "calling on another favor." Something to do with a mage associate of his, I believe.~
@219  = ~But here we are talking about Isaea, when that's the last thing he deserves. I will feel much better when we can forget all about his desperate grasping.~
@220  = ~You have been in Amn such a short time, and yet you have certainly left your mark. I could name several who have cheerfully given their right arm, or at least their neighbor's, to be half as influential.~ [PGNALI20]
@221  = ~Was it some philosophical treatise you read during a rebellious period at Candlekeep? Or are you as fed up with the injustice in the world as I am? I would like to know, <CHARNAME>, what makes you so driven when so many others simply allow life to happen to them.~
@222  = ~Driven? I fear not. I just keep doing what it looks like I am supposed to do in the hope that the world will turn out the way I want it to.~
@223  = ~You are very astute. In particular, I found the writings of an ancient Maztican shaman very influential. "Every man for himself," he wrote.~
@224  = ~I have lost too much of what I loved in my life to be passive.~
@225  = ~Justice needs a helping hand from time to time, and I love lending it.~
@226  = ~I would have thought it obvious. Protecting those I care about.~
@227  = ~I would have thought it obvious. Punishing those who dare cross me.~
@228  = ~You appear to be watching me. Tell me what you think it is that motivates me.~
@229  = ~It certainly does show, and I think personal conviction such as yours is just what more people need to build understanding and charity, not just for those we are tied to by blood or affection.~
@230  = ~Our experiences are a lesson, that personal conviction born of loyalty can have far-reaching effects even when they are not intended. We should continue to build on this, <CHARNAME>.~
@231  = ~I doubt you and I are on the same page, Nalia. I have no desire to be some sort of savior to the dregs. I am focused on Irenicus, and the weak can fend for themselves.~
@232  = ~We will, Nalia. I will never let you down.~
@233  = ~Your approval is not required, but it is appreciated.~
@234  = ~I can only hope to live up to the example set by men better than I, and be an example to those who will come after.~
@235  = ~You really are very sensitive about the needs of others, aren't you?~
@236  = ~I will extract your tonsils if you ever presume to lecture me again.~
@237  = ~I... I don't know exactly what to say. Thank you.~
@238  = ~I did not want to be the first to say so, <CHARNAME>, but yes. None can deny the magnitude of our struggles against wrongs, but if we only live to pursue our opponents, we run the risk of becoming barbarians rather than agents of positive change.~
@239  = ~I would like to see our energy spent not only to avenge, but to make the world a better place. It has to start somewhere... why not with us?~
@240  = ~Why not, indeed? I trust you will do your best to keep me in line, then?~
@241  = ~Because I have enough problems just hitting all the names on my list of enemies.~
@242  = ~You would accept that? From... from me? I don't know what to say...~
@243  = ~(sigh) That is exactly the sort of self-involved thinking I was hoping to avoid. But I am hopeful that you will see that there are bigger concerns than those that directly affect you or me.~
@244  = ~Of course it does. All too often the hand of justice is guided not by what is right, but by what is convenient.~
@245  = ~Too many forget that justice is for everyone, not just the strongest and the richest. As long as we keep that firmly in mind, I think your influence will be very well received by those whose opinions are worth counting.~
@246  = ~I know exactly what you mean! It was not until my mother died that I realized what a gap there would be in the lives of so many without her passion for doing good deeds. And I realized that I could not wait for another to take up that mantle.~
@247  = ~I appreciate that in you, <CHARNAME>. It is a very attractive quality in any leader.~
@248  = ~Thank you. You look very attractive to this leader as well. (wink)~
@249  = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>! How positively devilish, twisting my words like that! Such talk can only lead to scandal, you know.~
@250  = ~I... see. Well, I think it is my responsibility to make you aware of what I see, <CHARNAME>.~
@251  = ~You certainly are an experienced man of action but I have a certain advantage, having seen life both at the heights of society and through the eyes of the downtrodden. I hope you can come to appreciate that perspective as well.~
@252  = ~How very noble, <CHARNAME>. Which despite how I have used the word in the past, I intend now only in the purest sense of the word.~
@253  = ~So you trust in instinct. I know that many leaders do so very successfully, for a time, but so often they give in to baser instincts of greed and lust. It is a deep disappointment, when those we trust focus their energies not on the betterment of their fellows, but on extracting what they can from those they should protect.~
@254  = ~I am sworn to serve selflessly. I shall be most injured if you would imply I mean to do otherwise.~
@255  = ~In the service of my patron I give aid and comfort willingly. I shall be most injured if you would imply I mean to do otherwise.~
@256  = ~That is simply a matter of taking what one is owed. I myself plan to collect my fair share in due time.~
@257  = ~I think I have my leadership instincts well under control. I keep you in line, do I not?~
@258  = ~I shall try my best not to disappoint you, my Lady de'Arnise.~
@259  = ~Of course. I can't just sit idly by and watch suffering as so many who consider themselves above the plight of the common people do. That is why it is so important that we carry on my father's work, and remember that others need us in our travels.~
@260  = ~What? All I was doing... we were simply... you'll not lay a finger on me, fiend!~
@261  = ~I do not wish to quarrel with your beliefs, <CHARNAME>--I hold you in no small esteem or we would not still have the arrangement we do. But the only real guarantee of a man's integrity comes from the promises he makes to himself. Not to an assembly of other men who would judge him not by what is in his heart, but what is in his coin purse.~
@262  = ~Hah! We appear to have a very successful *partnership*. So your instincts, and mine, are in concordance thus far. I hope... I hope that they remain so aligned, for some time to come.~
@263  = ~Well--~
@264  = ~Of course--~
@265  = ~I--~
@266  = ~Excuse me, <CHARNAME>. I really must... study this spell.~
@267  = ~I am certainly not displeased by our current... working arrangement, <CHARNAME> But so many fall prey to temptation that I feel it is my duty to watch for such things. I have seen it more than once, you know... a powerful lord earning the devotion of his people through seemingly selfless acts only to collect painful penance when the tax revenues dip ever so slightly.~
@268  = ~No one is perfect, <CHARNAME>, even with the best of intentions, which if I may say so I do not believe you always have in mind.~
@269  = ~But there I go, lecturing you when there is work to be done. I hope my concerns do not unsettle you, <CHARNAME>. I simply must feel that what we do has positive implications not just for us, but for those who depend on people such as you and I to make the world a better place for them.~
@270  = ~I... I see. How very narrow-minded of you. You should open your eyes and see that there is more in the world than just your own concerns and struggles.~
@271  = ~A dangerous question, <CHARNAME>. That is the sort of question that causes less than formal dinner parties to end with bruises. But as you are bold enough to ask it, I will answer.~
@272  = ~I believe you are driven by convictions to do what must be done and compassionate enough to do so without causing undue harm to the innocent. No leader is perfect but I think you want to give people something to believe in.~
@273  = ~I believe I am blushing.~
@274  = ~And most importantly, I keep you in line. (wink)~
@275  = ~Only if they cough up the rewards when it is all said and done.~
@276  = ~I do believe you are! How... how charming. That is, I did not mean to embarrass you, I--~
@277  = ~I see someone who possesses the instinct to do what is right but does not always have the conviction to do it. These things are hard to learn when there are so many distractions, but I have every confidence in your ability to grow as a leader and an inspiration to others.~
@278  = ~I believe you are always looking for an advantage for yourself. There is no opportunity you would not like to exploit, given the opportunity. But you have restraint, which I respect.~
@279  = ~I am my own favorite charity, and I see nothing wrong with that.~
@280  = ~You wound me, lady Nalia. I am no villain.~
@281  = ~If I truly felt you were, we would not be partners in my family's land. But I would not be honest with you if I said anything different.~
@282  = ~I think you are driven by what you feel is best for you--the needs of others be damned if it suits you. I think this is short-sighted and hope you will learn from my example.~
@283  = ~You are letting a few isolated incidents color your perception. I care about people as much as you!~
@284  = ~Actions, <CHARNAME>, not words tell me who cares about the unfortunate and who simply wishes that problems would go away. But you will have every opportunity to prove yourself, I promise that much.~
@285  = ~Oh, where is the blasted thing? I just had it... There it is!~ [PGNALI21]
@286  = ~<CHARNAME>, my Memnon scarf is just behind your left foot. Would you--that is, please hand it to me. I'd hate for it to get dirty. Father bought it for me when we visited Memnon, you see.~ [PGNALI22]
@287  = ~Here you are. I had not noticed you wearing it before.~
@288  = ~Get it yourself. I am not your errand-boy.~
@289  = ~Oh, a memento, is it? What is it worth to you to get it back?~
@290  = ~What lovely colors! Memnon, you say? Where is that?~
@291  = ~What? I did say "please", didn't I?~
@292  = ~Oh, very well. It is not as though it is a great inconvenience to me. If you are unwilling to dirty your hands on my behalf, so be it. I am more than capable of getting it myself.~
@293  = ~Why, it's invaluable, of course. I don't think there is any price in gold worth one's memories, do you?~
@294  = ~Now, I would very much like my scarf returned, <CHARNAME>. Please.~
@295  = ~Gladly. In exchange from a single kiss from its rightful owner.~
@296  = ~Of course, Nalia, I was only teasing. So lovely... how did I not notice it on you before?~
@297  = ~Actually, I think it's mine now. Tough luck.~
@298  = ~I'll not endure such callous treatment! That is no mere thing to me, that is a cherished memory! If you cannot see that, then you are nothing like what I expected.~
@299  = ~The de'Arnise family never submits to blackmail, <CHARNAME>. And think of what the others would say!~
@300  = ~I'll simply take it back myself now. It has gotten quite dirty while we stood here... discussing.~
@301  = ~The de'Arnise family never submits to blackmail, <CHARNAME>. It is a rule we have lived by for generations.~
@302  = ~Perhaps I could, just this--no. No!~
@303  = ~I feel the magic you are using to persuade me, <CHARNAME>, and may I just say that I do not appreciate it in the slightest.~
@304  = ~But in this one instance, perhaps a slight suspension of the rules could be merited. At least, I don't see what it would hurt.~
@305  = ~(With an expression that tells you she's second-guessing her decision all the while, Nalia nervously licks her lips and honors your cheek with a firm, brief peck. At first she seems to be reaching her left arm around you in an embrace, but you realize a split-second too late that it was a diversion, as she pulls away with the scarf clutched in her right hand.)~
@306  = ~Thank you very much for your kind assistance, <CHARNAME>.~
@307  = ~Back at the Keep I often kept it in my chambers, but since I began traveling on my own and helping the needy, I try not to let it out of my sight.~
@308  = ~Of course, it isn't terribly practical. You can see how much attention it might attract if I wore it openly, as the silkmistresses of Memnon are so very talented with their bright designs. But one never knows when one might make it back to such a place when there is so much work to be done, and I would hate to lose it.~
@309  = ~So to keep it close, I often wear it under--that is, I simply do not always wear it out in the open. Yes.~
@310  = ~It is truly lovely. Perhaps someday we could travel to Memnon together, and we can find a matching brooch.~
@311  = ~I never would have thought you the sentimental type.~
@312  = ~Under, eh? That sounds very, very intriguing. Tell me more.~
@313  = ~Just put your scarf back on and let us be on our way.~
@314  = ~Such things are not polite conversation, <CHARNAME>, as I am sure you well know.~
@315  = ~I try not to dwell on the past, but I hold some things dear. It's the memory of my trip to Memnon with my father, more than the scarf itself, that matters to me.~
@316  = ~Thank you for returning my scarf. Now it carries one more memory for me.~
@317  = ~I... I think I would like that, <CHARNAME>. But only after our work here is done. There is so much to tend to in Amn before we can think of indulging any appetite for such diversions as a trip to Memnon.~
@318  = ~Have you been?~
@319  = ~To Memnon? No, but it sounds interesting. Where is it?~
@320  = ~Yes, I made it down there not long ago.~
@321  = ~You are better traveled than I thought--that is, I did not think you had much time for travel.~
@322  = ~Memnon lies near the border between Tethyr and Calimsham. Aunty spent a season there with one of their noble families when she was a girl, and she simply could not stop talking about how wonderful it was. It was her idea that Father take me there. I think she had visions of my remaining behind and being groomed as she was, but Father and I would have nothing of it.~
@323  = ~Looking back I realize that it is much like any other city, with its dirt and its privileged ingrates and the bitterly exploited serving classes. But at the time, it was something quite special to me, and this scarf reminds me of those times.~
@324  = ~What? Sorry, I got distracted when you said Delcia was once a girl. I simply do not believe it.~
@325  = ~So you were not always so jaded? There may be hope for you yet.~
@326  = ~Perhaps by visiting together, we could rediscover what made the city so magical for you.~
@327  = ~I am sure your father brought a beautiful girl to a beautiful city.~
@328  = ~Hah! I scarcely believed it myself, but my father swore to it. It was one of our private jokes when I was younger. I would ask him who was older, Father or Aunty, and he would always say, "Delcia has always been old."~
@329  = ~I wish I had asked him one more time before fleeing for help. I wish--oh, never mind.~
@330  = ~Jaded? I consider it the voice of experience and empathy. The problems of the world do not go away simply because some pretend that true equality and charity exist.~
@331  = ~Now I believe I may blush, <CHARNAME>.~
@332  = ~Things... things may look different with a companion in the city once more, yes. Not my father, but in some ways... I mean...~
@333  = ~I have been thinking about my time in Memnon again.~ [PGNALI23]
@334  = ~I remember watching the seamstresses and marveling at how quickly they worked for the benefit and luxury of others. I noticed that most of the young women wore thimbles to protect their fingers from the prick of the needle.~
@335  = ~As I grew older and mingled more with the lower classes I met more seamstresses, many of them older than those I watched in Memnon. And I noticed that many of them had given up wearing thimbles. Obviously they had pricked themselves so often so that others could enjoy finery that they no longer cared what happened to them.~
@336  = ~Don't you find that sad? That there are people so inured to suffering that they no longer take any precautions for their own well-being?~
@337  = ~I feel as they do, Nalia. Pricked so often that I am numb to the pain. Sometimes I just want to walk into a sword thrust and end it all.~
@338  = ~It is simply a question of skill, be it needle or sword. A recruit on his first day of camp cowers behind his shield, but a veteran campaigner knows how to dodge the blow entirely.~
@339  = ~You dwell on the stupidest things, Nalia. Who cares?~
@340  = ~I agree, there is nothing worse in all the world than to be so devoid of hope that you stop caring for yourself. I hope to never know such desperation.~
@341  = ~Some people know how to toughen up and get on with life. You could use a few more calluses yourself.~
@342  = ~As do I. Of course, I have been fortunate to have the freedom to do as I will, unlike those poor women forced into serving the whims of others. Still, there are moments of doubt, even for me.~
@343  = ~Perhaps for some, but as I watched them I noticed that many pricked themselves scarcely less often than the girls. It was harder to tell, because they did not wince, they did not bleed... they did not feel. They were not spared the jab, they simply ignored it.~
@344  = ~I know that I can change lives for the better. I have seen the gratitude in the eyes of those who have benefited from my efforts. But when I ask myself what I can do to restore hope to the completely hopeless, sometimes the answer does not come. I would do whatever it was, if only I knew.~
@345  = ~It takes true strength of character to suffer and harden and persevere. Do not condemn those women, learn from them.~
@346  = ~Start small, Nalia. Have you ever considered ASKING them how you could help?~
@347  = ~Their mood will undoubtedly improve when the streets run red with the blood of the nobility. Revolution is inevitable.~
@348  = ~Give them something to live for. A better future.~
@349  = ~Best to just put them out of their misery with a bigger sharp, pointy object they will not be able to ignore.~
@350  = ~I do not see hopelessness as something to be envied, <CHARNAME>. Obviously you and I are simply of two different minds on the subject of human suffering.~
@351  = ~Have I...? Well, of course, but it is so hard to bridge the artificial barriers between us. And I have found that those in need are often ill-equipped to articulate their needs, whether because they are denied proper education or because they are unwilling to tell the truth to someone they recognize as belonging to the upper classes who cause them to suffer in the first place. They fear reprisal, you see.~
@352  = ~I will not give up on them or any other who needs my aid. I could wish for greater success, however.~
@353  = ~A chilling image, <CHARNAME>... and if you will permit me, one that I have seen in my darker dreams as well, from time to time. But obviously unnecessary.~
@354  = ~The upper classes will simply have to face the facts, and recognize that sharing the spoils is not only the right thing to do but will result in a better world for them, one where they do not need to travel with an entourage of guards simply to walk through the slums they created.~
@355  = ~Equality will bring safety, and that is a world I want to live in.~
@356  = ~That is... that is in no way amusing, <CHARNAME>! I am appalled, and shall speak to you no more of important matters.~
@357  = ~Oh, no! <CHARNAME>, I won't hear of such things. You know full well that you have both great power and great responsibility. You can't simply give up!~
@358  = ~Think of those who depend on you and your good deeds, <CHARNAME>, as well as your friends. I know that I would certainly miss you.~
@359  = ~Ahem. That is, I know that my work is considerably easier with a strong ally such as yourself. As I knew it would be when I engaged you for the defense of the Keep.~
@360  = ~You really mean that, Nalia? You care about what happens to me?~
@361  = ~It is not enough to fill the dead space inside me.~
@362  = ~Thank you, that helps. It's remarkable, you know just what to say.~
@363  = ~Are you certain there is no other reason you want to keep me nearby?~
@364  = ~Why, of course. It would be such a terrible waste to have to find a new partner in the Keep. And... and I will be so bold as to say that I enjoy your company very much, <CHARNAME>.~
@365  = ~We are living proof that classes need not be kept separate from one another. I think both our lives are richer from what we've learned from one another already.~
@366  = ~You are not the only one who has known that feeling, <CHARNAME>. I myself felt it when I saw my father lying dead, and I knew there was nothing in the world that would bring him back. But I went on, because I knew his death only meant the beginning of a new stage of my life.~
@367  = ~Despite all the injustice in this world, almost everyone pushes on with their lives, for better or for worse. I am quite certain you have the strength to be better than the ordinary men who endure.~
@368  = ~It is true, Father spared no small amount of time to educate me in the diplomatic arts, but I believe the truth of the matter is that you are far easier to talk to than I could have suspected when we first met. It feels almost natural now, and I feel--~
@369  = ~--that is, I believe I know you well enough by now to know what you wish to hear.~
@370  = ~Shall we carry on?~
@371  = ~I care, quite obviously. And it is just as obvious that expecting you to understand me is a waste of energy.~
@372  = ~If you'll excuse a waggish play on words, that's rather a callous attitude.~
@373  = ~Hope is all some people have to live for, and to see it taken away like that, to see people who do not care for their own bodies, saddens me. I cannot dismiss their situation so easily. But... at the same time, when I see such hopelessness I wonder if there is truly anything I can do to help.~
@374  = ~I am firmly convinced that our cities are so corrupt not just because of deliberate greed, but because people who could do more to stop the suffering are content to rest on the laurels of one or two accomplishments. They improve a slum or feed a starving family and they consider their life's work complete.~ [PGNALI26]
@375  = ~They should learn, as I have, that those gestures are but the stepping stones to meaningful change. It is very well and good to take pride in them, but surely you agree that especially those as young as you and I, the real future of our society, cannot rest easy on a few noble deeds.~ [PGNALI27]
@376  = ~I'm curious, <CHARNAME>. What accomplishment are you most proud of? What will you build upon for the rest of your life?~
@377  = ~I am so great, so accomplished, so fully realized in my potential that I simply do not know where to begin.~
@378  = ~I am proud that I have become the man that I believe Gorion wanted me to be.~
@379  = ~You tell me first.~
@380  = ~My proudest moment? Figuring out how to spy on you while you change your clothes.~
@381  = ~Being the worthy successor to Bhaal, the only one suited to carry on in his glorious footsteps.~
@382  = ~Sending Sarevok to the great beyond, proving that for all his supposed genius, I was the better man.~
@383  = ~Ending Sarevok's mad scheme to incite a bloody war.~
@384  = ~I can think of nothing that pleases me more than knowing that Imoen is safe.~
@385  = ~Putting an end to Firkraag's reign of terror, of course.~
@386  = ~Earning the endorsement of my patron as a holy warrior was the proudest moment of my life.~
@387  = ~I take great pride in every deed I do in my deity's name.~
@388  = ~I am proud to be able to apply lessons of mind and body to achieve discipline and enlightenment, without need for material things.~
@389  = ~ It was the day I realized there was no lock, no trap, no guard that I could not defeat. The world became my oyster.~
@390  = ~The day I learned to love magic. It was like a whole new world of possibilities opened up to me.~
@391  = ~I can't even imagine what that must be like. And yet the knightly orders are so full of formality and ceremony that they often ignore the suffering outside their own doors. I'm sure you, who have spent so much time on the road and among the suffering, know first-hand what I mean.~
@392  = ~I can't even imagine what that must be like. But I feel it best not to rely on any higher power than ourselves for guidance and inspiration. The gods allow suffering but they give us the power to fight it, if we have the will. That is what I think you should build upon.~
@393  = ~I can't even imagine what having such self-control must be like. But if we become too introspective we can ignore those who need us, and I don't care to think about the implications of that at all.~
@394  = ~Hah! Oh, I know exactly how you feel, <CHARNAME>. But don't you see that such skills are simply a means to an end, to make the world change even when locks and outdated laws stand in our way?~
@395  = ~Oh, I know exactly how you feel, <CHARNAME>. But don't you see that spells and incantations are simply a means to an end, to make the world change when people and their rules and worldly strength would see the old, bloated, unjust status quo continue?~
@396  = ~I see, your loyalty to your loved ones trumps all. We must sometimes put their needs and our own aside for the greater good, however.~
@397  = ~The dragon was indeed a menace to so many, although his quarrel with Windspear seemed quite personal. Still, it was an evil beast who doubtless ruined the lives of untold numbers of victims. Yes, that's certainly an achievement to build upon.~
@398  = ~That... that is completely...~
@399  = ~What's done is done but I find it entirely unacceptable, and insist that it never happen again.~
@400  = ~How distressing! There must be more than such a chilling destiny for you. Perhaps you can draw some inspiration from my path.~
@401  = ~Sarevok was clearly not a man to be emulated. But you base your worth on killing one man? That hardly seems like something to build upon.~
@402  = ~And in so doing, saved the lives of countless thousands, I'm sure. And think of the widows and children unmade as well. That is indeed an inspiring thought.~
@403  = ~Hmph. And your modesty is certainly beyond compare as well, I'm sure.~
@404  = ~Studied, capable, compassionate... even modest. I'm sure any father could approve of that.~
@405  = ~I obviously never knew your father but in my own experience, that is a very dangerous assumption to make. Especially if Gorion was anything like Father, and held you to your own standards. We are our own harshest critics, you know.~
@406  = ~I think you'll be surprised. You would have good reason to think I would say that it was the time I single-handedly drove a food caravan to starving families on the northern border, or the time I--quite literally and scandalously--gave a war veteran in rags the shirt off my back. But it isn't.~
@407  = ~It was the day that I learned to look beyond name and rank and social status when I met someone. The day I realized that everyone has hopes and dreams and does not simply exist to serve the snobby and the privileged.~
@408  = ~My parents had said such things to me but it took some time to know it in my heart. And when I did... when I realized what it meant, that but for birth and upbringing I was no different than millions of others, my life changed for the better. And I am quite proud to have come to that realization.~
@409  = ~But you don't actually believe that you're no different or better than anyone else. You wouldn't trade places and possessions with a washerwoman, would you?~
@410  = ~I see why you have such a beautiful soul.~
@411  = ~By the gods, Nalia, you truly are a simplistic sap.~
@412  = ~But, Nalia, we ARE better than normal people.~
@413  = ~That sort of epiphany has not hit me yet.~
@414  = ~And I am quite certain that even prouder moments await us.~
@415  = ~Of course not. Neither of us is equipped to carry the other's burdens. It would be unfair to her as much as me. But the day will come when the differences are not so severe, and stepping into each other's shoes might not be so unthinkable.~
@416  = ~I appreciate that. Thank you for the kind words of encouragement, <CHARNAME>. It's nice to be understood.~
@417  = ~You are not the first to say so, <CHARNAME>. Quite frankly I am immune to those knee-jerk criticisms. You must simply be like the rest and fear change.~
@418  = ~Better? Better educated, better prepared, of course. But it is thinking that we are born better than others that created the system of inequalities in the first place! We should consider ourselves lucky for the differences we benefit from, but never delude ourselves into thinking that it makes us morally superior.~
@419  = ~Allow yourself to see the world as I do, <CHARNAME>. You will see what I see.~
@420  = ~I want the legacy of my life to be more than individual accomplishment. But I know that if I can change just one person's life for the better each day, and they are willing to do the same... why, before you know it, the world will be what I know it can be. Equitable, just, and fair. For everyone, not just for those who make the rules.~
@421  = ~Why wait? Let us knock down the walls and declare the Keep commons! That will change a lot of lives right away.~
@422  = ~You have a lot to learn about life and how to live it, Nalia. One person cannot change the world so dramatically.~
@423  = ~I wish you and your dream well, but it is a lot to ask for. Not everyone is as pure-hearted as you hope.~
@424  = ~Brilliant!~
@425  = ~As a rule-maker myself, I am not certain I like your tone.~
@426  = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>, of course I've considered that but it would be unbridled chaos! Frustrations spilling over, no accountability of any sort... I do not wish to think ill of our people, but really, redistribution of wealth is not something that can be done overnight. Presenting the common people with so much temptation with no preparation would be rather inconsiderate.~
@427  = ~So are you going to tell me your proudest moment? It would only be fair.~
@428  = ~(say nothing)~
@429  = ~I thought so! Thank you for the kind words of encouragement, <CHARNAME>. It's nice to be understood.~
@430  = ~History is full of those who have. Some of the people we have met would even consider you one of them. So, no, <CHARNAME>, I cannot agree. I can, so I shall.~
@431  = ~Oh, of course it cannot happen overnight, but even those who have been denied the finer details of civilized education appreciate that what is good for their neighbor is also good for them. In time, I believe most everyone can be made to see that.~
@432  = ~Sooner or later the world will not need people such as you and I to impose their benevolent will. Not overnight, but someday. Embrace the inevitability, <CHARNAME>. Surely you have felt the burden of responsibility as I have. When the world is not so driven by greed and selfishness, there will be less need for our strong guiding hands.~
@433  = ~Now that I have shared, I would very much like to hear your answer.~
@434  = ~I think you should know that you are not required to answer my questions. Or answer to me at all, if you do not wish to.~ [PGNALI29]
@435  = ~What brought this on? Have I not paid full attention to your every word?~
@436  = ~Excellent. I shall start ignoring you forthwith.~
@437  = ~But that would be terribly rude. For who will answer you, if not me?~
@438  = ~I do not answer TO you but I will always answer you. I enjoy talking to you, Nalia, and I like to hear what you think.~
@439  = ~You... oh, very well, then.~
@440  = ~Hah! It would certainly be a lonely feeling.~
@441  = ~A very thoughtful thing to say, but I must inquire into your motives.~
@442  = ~It's simply... I simply want you to see me as Nalia, not as "Lady de'Arnise."~
@443  = ~I do not want you to feel beholden to me. It is you who have come to my aid on more than one occasion, and you do not owe me any oath of loyalty or service. I simply worry that you might feel pressured by outdated custom to pay me more respect than I am due.~
@444  = ~You are not my hireling. I am not your liege lady. I hope that is sufficiently clear. So please drop any pretense.~
@445  = ~But, Nalia, I do not feel that way. Are you sure it is not you who is having difficulty? Worried about falling into old habits, perhaps?~
@446  = ~My attention to you is genuine, Nalia. Is it so hard to accept that I am interested in you?~
@447  = ~It is my sworn duty to serve you, Lady de'Arnise. Respectful attention included.~
@448  = ~I have never been one for empty tradition. You have earned my consideration, it is not given out of obligation.~
@449  = ~You could not tell me what to do if you tried.~
@450  = ~Of... of course not.~
@451  = ~No, I merely wanted to be very clear about where we stand. I realize that my position sometimes causes discomfort outside the usual noble circles, but as we are spending so much time together on so many important works, I felt it important to explain that I demand no special considerations from you.~
@452  = ~And I respect you for that, <CHARNAME>. It is exactly that sort of independent thought so many of the so-called upper classes would believe you incapable of. We know far more than they do!~
@453  = ~You should know that I have great respect and confidence in your giving nature.~
@454  = ~I should like to see some more generosity in our dealings, but I trust in you to make meaningful improvements.~
@455  = ~Nonsense. You are not some knight sworn to shower women with flowery language and stoic service and I am not one to accept such a thing. I believe in the power of individuals, not titles, <CHARNAME>.~
@456  = ~Oh, no! THIS is precisely why the knightly orders frustrate me to no end! They perpetuate artificial barriers between individuals, all for the sake of some stuffy old lords who enjoy nothing but ceremonies full of knights standing around polishing their lances!~
@457  = ~I'm... I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>. I should not be so rude. But you MUST see that whatever the social registries may say about us, we are simply two individuals joined in pursuit of common goals. I am not your Lady OR your damsel in distress.~
@458  = ~You shall always be my Lady, but I understand you.~
@459  = ~I have never been so insulted in my entire life. I demand a duel to restore the honor of my Order. Have at you!~
@460  = ~You ask me to be something I am not. I am a Paladin, and that has a very special and sacred meaning.~
@461  = ~I will not travel with one who speaks so basely of my calling. Leave now, before I say something cross.~
@462  = ~I can see this will be difficult for you. So, simply follow my lead, and I am sure you will come to understand.~
@463  = ~Oh, damn it all... I am truly sorry...~
@464  = ~Good.~
@465  = ~Of course, I shall continue to offer my input as I see fit, and you may take it as you see fit. So long as we both understand that we are not playing some archaic dance of mistress and servant.~
@466  = ~Damn. I was looking forward to a good game of "Mistress and Servant" tonight. I suppose that means I will need a new mistress.~
@467  = ~Keep your trap shut or you won't live to regret it.~
@468  = ~Mark my words, Nalia. Some day, you will not feel it necessary to be so formal with me.~
@469  = ~Any time.~
@470  = ~<CHARNAME>! You'll send Aunty to an early grave with talk like that!~
@471  = ~I intend to live a long and fruitful life, and not in such abusive company!~
@472  = ~I... I think I would like that very much, <CHARNAME>.~
@473  = ~Naturally.~
@474  = ~Aunty would have me believe that every time I give some pittance to an exploited man, I throw another shovelful of dirt on the way of life for the nobility in general and my own life in particular. Well, the nobility be damned! I'll not turn my back when asked for alms.~ [PGNALI30]
@475  = ~But, you see, she simply will not stop trying to haunt me with the ghost of Mother. "Remember how she died!" she always shrieks. "Traipsing about with filthy indigents!"~
@476  = ~Of course, I hardly listen to Aunty anymore when she's in one of THOSE moods. Yet... there is some truth to what she says.~
@477  = ~That man was a drunken liar, you know.~
@478  = ~I do not follow. I thought your mother was some great noble lady. Are you saying she was a commoner?~
@479  = ~You have seen the ghost of your mother?~
@480  = ~Why do you care what your aunt thinks at all?~
@481  = ~I think it is splendid that you do what you want to do in the face of opposition and danger, Nalia. Quite commendable.~
@482  = ~Nalia, even if I had the time to spare for these little chats, I would not spare it. You bore me.~
@483  = ~Then I will not occupy any more of your precious moments!~
@484  = ~And if the man has taken to drink, who is to blame? Society gives people so few places to turn when their ship sails--and whether that man was ever a sailor or not does not matter. His ship DID sail without him, one way or another.~
@485  = ~But I am not convinced, as some are, that there is no capacity for self-improvement. It's simply a matter of trust.~
@486  = ~Hah! No, of course not. It's a figure of speech, <CHARNAME>. Aunty mentions Mother regularly in an attempt to frighten me.~
@487  = ~She means well, and thinks she has my best interests in mind. And I remind myself that if I have the compassion to listen to the pleadings of beggars, I should extend the same courtesy to family.~
@488  = ~Oh, goodness, no. No, my parents did not strain the social order THAT drastically. Mother was a Celevnon, and she brought considerable forest holdings to their union. Surely you have heard of the famous Celevnon timber? The white oak... anyway, it doesn't matter.~
@489  = ~Danger... yes, it is rather perilous at times.~
@490  = ~Mother was not unlike myself as you see me today. She was my role model, really. She would go off for days at a time into the towns bringing comfort and cheer to the downtrodden. Usually she went in disguise, of course, as it would have been rather embarrassing for her to be followed back to the Keep.~
@491  = ~She had responsibilities at home as well, of course. It is not as though I had an absent mother while growing up.~
@492  = ~When I was still a girl, she took a fateful journey to a logging camp on our family's lands. She left them with blankets and clothing, for the upcoming winter was expected to be extremely harsh. But she came back with the plague.~
@493  = ~At... at least it was over quickly. Father was utterly devastated, and not at all easy to talk to for quite a while. In time, of course, Aunty came to live with us... she was not so long widowed and it seemed to be the perfect arrangement, since her own marriage had never given her any children.~
@494  = ~At least you had a mother. As both father and mother to me, Gorion was but one man.~
@495  = ~How terrible, to see your own mother waste away... I'm so sorry, Nalia.~
@496  = ~Delcia has no children, you say? Why am I not surprised...~
@497  = ~Your aunt is right. Learn your lesson already, girl! Pitiful poor people are deadly dangerous!~
@498  = ~She died as she lived. A loss, but a fine woman to the end.~
@499  = ~I am certain he tried his very best, <CHARNAME>. I have seen enough to know that one parent who cares is worth a hundred disinterested mothers or fathers, who regard their children as trophies... or worse, not at all.~
@500  = ~Time heals, <CHARNAME>. I don't have the luxury of time to brood.~
@501  = ~Now, <CHARNAME>, really. I only met him the one time but Lord Caan was a perfectly nice man, and I don't think Aunty pushed him around the way she--well, the way she has been known to act towards those who she does not deem worthy of her respect.~
@502  = ~Disease does not discriminate, <CHARNAME>. My mother is perfect proof! And infirmity strikes even those who build their ivory towers. No, she would not take back anything she did and neither would I.~
@503  = ~Yes, she did. She never gave up on her principles, and she never cast any blame.~
@504  = ~I only wish that we had had more time together. There was so much I could have learned from Mother.~
@505  = ~You see, <CHARNAME>--and this is something I have never told another soul--not long before she took ill, she confided in me that she occasionally gave more to the poor than simply what she and Father allocated from the coffers.~
@506  = ~Back on her family lands was a guards officer who, it seemed, had been a bit of an infiltrator-for-hire in his younger days. A spy, really. Mother found out somehow, and in exchange for her silence he agreed to show her the basics of going places other people don't want you to be.~
@507  = ~She was not averse to liberating a few stones from a greedy merchant or purloining a bit of silver from the table of a dinner host who exploited his house staff, then passing the proceeds on to those who needed them more. You cannot imagine how proud I was of her, and how exciting it all sounded!~
@508  = ~I begged her to take me with her but she said it was too dangerous. Eventually I convinced her to prepare me for my own career of aiding the downtrodden. For my tenth birthday, she showed me how to pick the lock on the larders for the first time. I still remember the sound of scratching around in that old keyhole!~
@509  = ~Alas, we did not get much further than the merits of drab clothing for remaining unseen when she died. But I learned enough to be dangerous, as they say, and I learned enough to know what questions to ask when I encountered the right sort to further my underground education.~
@510  = ~The rest of the story you already know. In time, I agreed to focus my attention on the study of magic in exchange for being left alone.~
@511  = ~I had no idea your family had such a deep rebellious streak.~
@512  = ~I had no idea your mother was a common thief. Your father must have been furious.~
@513  = ~So your mother preferred the company of common men as well, eh? Like mother, like daughter.~
@514  = ~I wonder what your mother would think about us.~
@515  = ~I can see why you are so different than the other women I have met. You had a very special mother.~
@516  = ~When you say it like that, it sounds as though we were doing something wrong. Trying to level the playing field for the powerless is no crime. I consider myself very fortunate to have learned that at such a young age. Perhaps someday I can be the same sort of example... but that will be a long way off.~
@517  = ~My mother was ANYTHING but common, <CHARNAME>. And I won't hear you speak of her in such a manner.~
@518  = ~Why, I resent that implication, <CHARNAME>. My parents loved each other very much, and as for "common" men, I prefer those who know when to keep a civil tongue. They are decidedly UN-common, as you have just reminded me.~
@519  = ~Of us...? I... I imagine she would be pleased enough to see me carrying on her work among like-minded company.~
@520  = ~Yes. I'm sure that's what she would see in us. Excuse me, <CHARNAME>, I have to check my gear for a spell component I may have lost.~
@521  = ~Indeed I did. And I would say the same to any who would mistakenly envy me for the wealth I was born to. I consider myself far luckier to have been born to love than money.~
@522  = ~It is my experience that some of the greatest disappointments are caused not by what we do, but by what we choose not to do. When we fail ourselves the worst, our inaction is to blame.~ [PGNALI31]
@523  = ~<CHARNAME>, have you ever *not* done something, then had cause to regret it later?~
@524  = ~"No regrets" is my personal motto.~
@525  = ~Skip the feigned interest, Nalia. Just tell me what is on your mind.~
@526  = ~I feel very guilty about Imoen. I feel as though I've done nothing.~
@527  = ~I regret not leaping through the fray to wring Irenicus's neck with my bare hands while I had the chance.~
@528  = ~I regret not spending more time with Gorion... while there still was time.~
@529  = ~I regret not leaving you bound and gagged on the side of a road. Your interruptions are at an end.~
@530  = ~I regret not learning more from Sarevok before I killed him. I could have succeeded where he failed.~
@531  = ~I regret not saving more lives from Sarevok's madness. But he was one step ahead of me for so long.~
@532  = ~You're probably not being honest with yourself. But I suppose that cocksure nature serves you.~
@533  = ~My interest is genuine, <CHARNAME>. I have no reason to feign anything around you, as you are not some grubby social-climber looking to have his aspirations validated by a polite, empty word.~
@534  = ~There is certainly something we can do about that. It should be a simple matter, considering what we have already overcome. I am sure you will do the right thing soon.~
@535  = ~A very... vivid image.~
@536  = ~I know exactly how you feel, <CHARNAME>. Better than I ever wished to.~
@537  = ~Hmph! They certainly are!~
@538  = ~I had something more... noble in mind, I believe.~
@539  = ~That sort of destruction was something no one could have foreseen. I am quite certain you did everything you could.~
@540  = ~In any case, I feel I have little to regret. I do not turn down those in need, I do not procrastinate. But I have not always been so decisive.~
@541  = ~You saw the... the cellars at the Keep. My father put an end to the brutality of a dungeon soon after he became Lord, and they were never used as anything but storage or animal cages.~
@542  = ~Except once. You see, Father did not accept Mother's death easily. For although she died of plague after visiting that camp, the fact is--and very few know this, <CHARNAME>--there were no other plague victims at that camp. As a result, he suspected foul play.~
@543  = ~I thought that was obvious.~
@544  = ~Who would bear such a grudge?~
@545  = ~I would have razed the place if I suspected such a plot against one I loved.~
@546  = ~We did not want to assume the worst, <CHARNAME>.~
@547  = ~I shall get to that.~
@548  = ~He sent soldiers to investigate and they came back with a man who they said had given her an infected blanket. He was foreign to our lands and he did not deny it, but he seemed vacant, as though his mind was not entirely his own. Father had him caged. I... I don't know that they tortured him but I know he was not comfortable.~
@549  = ~I was forbidden near the cellars but I managed to visit him, once. It... it was quite awful. Perhaps because Father kept no jailer... in any case, he was barely able to speak, but when I told him who I was and that I wanted to know the truth, he told me that a strange cat beast had enchanted him and forced him to poison Mother.~
@550  = ~Ridiculous!~
@551  = ~Did he seem sincere?~
@552  = ~He might have said anything to escape.~
@553  = ~Why didn't you let him go, then?~
@554  = ~I didn't know what that could mean, at the time, but I tried to talk to Father... he refused to speak of him. I told Aunty and she... well, you know how she can be. Let us just say she dismissed me.~
@555  = ~He died, not long after. I know, now, that creature he described could have been a rakshasa. Father captured their great weapon and I am certain they never forgot that. They could have hurt Mother in order to hurt him. It wouldn't surprise me based on what I have heard of them.~
@556  = ~And I simply cannot forget that I did nothing. I didn't make them see that they were punishing an innocent man!~
@557  = ~You had no way of knowing for sure that the man was the victim of sorcery. It was not your fault.~
@558  = ~That story sounds pretty dubious to me. He was probably just trying to play on the heartstrings of an innocent young girl.~
@559  = ~What do you really think you could have done?~
@560  = ~What a brilliant plot on their part.~
@561  = ~That is quite shameful. It is despicable that your family would murder so callously.~
@562  = ~You tried, Nalia. You tried your best.~
@563  = ~My voice should have counted! I should have made it count. But I gave up and left the matter in the hands of others. I did nothing.~
@564  = ~No more. I will never make that mistake again.~
@565  = ~If... if I have acted indecorously, I apologize. I merely thought I could share a memory, but I got carried away. Thank you for sparing the time, <CHARNAME>. I am most appreciative of the time you spend listening to my meanderings.~
@566  = ~Of course he was desperate, he was dying! But I don't believe he lied to me.~
@567  = ~Why would he wish my mother ill? He had no money or markings that would indicate he was working for a rival baron. He could have been an unwitting tool, and I should have seen it! But I let him die because it was too much work to save him.~
@568  = ~I could have tried harder, made Father take a good long look at him, have him examined by mages... anything! Anything besides letting him die.~
@569  = ~I... I don't know who you are when you say such things.~
@570  = ~It was, it was a terrible weakness, but Father was hurt so deeply and when the plague was not found at the camp there were so many questions! It was easiest to let him die, and we did so!~
@571  = ~I... I feel wretched, <CHARNAME>. I do not blame you for speaking your mind, but I believe I would like to be alone for a time.~
@572  = ~There is certainly much to be seen in the world when the artificial boundaries of castle and title are brushed aside. I have seen more of the real world these past few weeks than a hundred Roenalls or Delcias might see in a lifetime, and I have you to thank for it.~
@573  = ~It has been very different traveling with you. On my own, I was perhaps less willing to... let us say, to fully embrace all of the opportunities presented. And it goes without saying that it is absolutely nothing like my journeys with Aunty.~
@574  = ~As liberating as this is, I must admit that I still give some thought to scandal arising from such a closely knit partnership. I suppose the necessities of camp are little different from the joint barracks of the Keep, but I am not sure even I entirely believe that.~
@575  = ~On the other hand, you seem quite comfortable. Tell me, are you very accustomed to keeping such close quarters with women?~
@576  = ~Why, yes, Nalia. Look around you.~
@577  = ~Not really, but I made a special exception just for you.~
@578  = ~N-no, uh, not really.~
@579  = ~I am not accustomed to your damnable interruptions! Be silent!~
@580  = ~I will travel with anyone, man or woman. It matters little. I only "keep close quarters" with very special women, however.~
@581  = ~Oh, yes, all the time. I mean, no, not all the time, not THAT close. I mean... what was the question again?~
@582  = ~What's making you so uncomfortable, Nalia?~
@583  = ~Very well. You shall have nothing from me BUT my silence.~
@584  = ~No? Oh. Perhaps I was mistaken when I said you were comfortable. I can certainly relate to a degree of unease.~
@585  = ~Oh. I--I see. I'm not sure I know much about that.~
@586  = ~Hah! I am not sure I recall any longer, <CHARNAME>!~
@587  = ~I was simply musing about men and women, together. Our arrangement is certainly different than any I have participated in before.~
@588  = ~How flattering! It has certainly afforded me a perspective I would never have seen back at the Keep, or even on my own personal errands of mercy.~
@589  = ~Yes, I realize I am not the only woman in your company, <CHARNAME>. I was always wondering if it was always so.~
@590  = ~Not long after I was out on my own, I met up with Jaheira, and since she wouldn't go away, I decided to get used to it.~
@591  = ~I was so close to Imoen growing up that I suppose I feel very comfortable with females.~
@592  = ~There were precious few women at Candlekeep. Perhaps I am making up for lost time. Does it matter?~
@593  = ~I have barely noticed. It does not matter to me, I do not choose my friends based on their gender.~
@594  = ~I admit a fondness for the fairer sex, yes. Can you blame me?~
@595  = ~I see.~
@596  = ~Perhaps I am hearing Delcia's voice when I should be listening to my own, but this experience is rather new to me.~
@597  = ~As long as you do not see me as just part of some harem, no, I suppose not. I imagine you and I share a certain curiosity because of our upbringings, different though they were.~
@598  = ~A very progressive attitude, <CHARNAME>. But even among open-minded people such as ourselves, or my parents, there are many opportunities to keep people away from experiencing all of the perspectives life has to offer.~
@599  = ~Oh, of course I have spent a great deal of time with both men and women--the servants, bondsmen and guards of the Keep came from all walks of life and Father evaluated the sword-arm of men and women equally. Perhaps it is because I was not lucky enough to have a sibling, or someone very much like one, as you had Imoen.~
@600  = ~Lucky? To have Imoen? That's a matter of perspective...~
@601  = ~I did learn a great deal from her, but not having any siblings does not make you a bad person.~
@602  = ~She's the best, that much is true.~
@603  = ~It must have been painfully lonely for you.~
@604  = ~No, but I do believe I missed something very important.~
@605  = ~Only when I saw how things were different for children who had siblings. The servants often had such large families... but I digress.~
@606  = ~Of course, it is not as though I have never spent time on my own terms with a man before. One cannot set foot a league from the Copper Coronet without being accosted by all sorts of men, but I understand that they are hardly good examples.~
@607  = ~I was escorted to some perfectly hideous debutante balls by gentlemen callers... and I will thank you in advance not to ask me to recount Isaea's ooze-ridden "courtship." I have even spent the odd night hidden under a spare bunk in the barracks just to overhear the guards' conversations.~
@608  = ~But this is very different, <CHARNAME>. And I--I have come to realize that what is most different about it is you. I do not want you to think of yourself as a hireling or servant. I certainly do not.~
@609  = ~I have come to appreciate just how much I enjoy our time together. You have been more loyal and supportive than anyone motivated by greed or personal gain could, and I admire that, <CHARNAME>. I admire it greatly, and I find myself feeling that for my own very selfish reasons I would hate to lose the friendship you have shared with me.~
@610  = ~I had no idea you felt so strongly, Nalia. I am speechless.~
@611  = ~Our friendship is in no danger of doing anything but growing. Does that frighten you?~
@612  = ~Does this mean we will be enjoying some real "close quarters" soon?~
@613  = ~Friendship, Nalia? I feel more for you than mere friendship.~
@614  = ~Perhaps that is because I have said too much already.~
@615  = ~Not... not that I regret what I've said.~
@616  = ~I... I don't know, <CHARNAME>. I don't think so.~
@617  = ~I should really finish updating my spell book. I think I have said entirely too much.~
@618  = ~<CHARNAME>! I said I respected your friendship, I did not expect to be... to be... propositioned!~
@619  = ~You... you mean, for me?~
@620  = ~I miss them terribly, each and every day, but I am glad that you and I are carrying on the work my parents started. It would be better to have them here with us, helping to carry the burden, but it is comforting to know that we are following in their footsteps. It helps me to remember them better.~
@621  = ~I am quite sure your enthusiasm and drive would put them to shame. I prefer to think that we are blazing our own trail, Nalia.~
@622  = ~Me? Follow some stuffed shirt's impractical ideals? Surely you jest.~
@623  = ~Of course. I am always more than pleased to do what is just and kind, in your family's name as well as my own.~
@624  = ~And it pleases me to know that you are comforted, but try not to get too far ahead of yourself.~
@625  = ~Have them here with us? I think that would be a bit crowded.~
@626  = ~You mean the work of locking up innocent men and leaving them to die? Yes, that's been very important to carry on.~
@627  = ~I rather like the sound of that, <CHARNAME>! I think the mindset pounded into the nobility can cause us to lose sight of setting our own course.~
@628  = ~Whether you mean to or not, the fact remains. Of course, it would be better if my father were still here to carry his own banner, but I am quite sure he would approve of your surrogacy. Even the rather devious method we used to thwart the Roenalls.~
@629  = ~Oh, of course not! Our methods are far too risky, far too direct for the propriety my father had to maintain. But we would have had their support, I am quite sure of that.~
@630  = ~Memories are such a strange thing. The mind wanders... I never see only what I thought I was looking for when I began digging up the memory.~
@631  = ~I suppose it might be considered strange that Father never discussed his wishes in the event of his death. Father knew better than to try to change my conduct, of course, but that he never left instructions for our Keep and our lands, with no wife and no descendants but me... yes, it is odd.~
@632  = ~He knew full well what I thought of Isaea, so he certainly would not have expected me to just accept Isaea pressing that sham betrothal. And I did not want him to think I was suddenly taking a morbid and materialistic interest in inheritance, so I simply never asked.~
@633  = ~Perhaps he felt he would live forever.~
@634  = ~He trusted in you implicitly. It sounded as though he loved you very much, so why would he not trust you?~
@635  = ~Perhaps he simply did not care what happened after his death.~
@636  = ~Strange. Gorion put events in motion to see that I was looked after in the event of his death. I thought that was something all fathers did.~
@637  = ~I doubt he could have told you anything you did not already know.~
@638  = ~No, I don't think so. Bonchy, on the other hand... Bonchy is certain he will live forever, or die trying. Not Father. He buried too many friends, not to mention Mother.~
@639  = ~Yes, I suppose. Just silly, unbidden thoughts, as I said.~
@640  = ~Oh, no! No, <CHARNAME>, my father spent years building a legacy, not for himself but for the people and families that live and work on our lands! If he was some sort of short-sighted hedonist, things would have been much different, I assure you. And that is not the sort of behavior that I would be likely to miss!~
@641  = ~Father had good reason to trust in our guard, although we saw that the attackers were able to subvert even Glaicus. So he did prepare, in his way. But not for the continuation of the Keep, it would seem.~
@642  = ~I miss the voice of his experience, but you are right, <CHARNAME>. I am a faster learner than most. But there could have been time for one more lesson between for us, I am sure.~
@643  = ~It hardly matters, as I am quite sure we are in the right.~
@644  = ~Ha! Here are those unbidden thoughts again. I am trying to imagine the daily arguments, the condescension, the sheer intolerability that would have been life with Isaea--the life I am sure he felt he was entitled to ensnare me in as soon as word reached him that Father died in the attack.~
@645  = ~The Keep would be nothing like we have helped make it, and I certainly can't see myself looking forward to each new day the way I do now.~
@646  = ~Not that our situation compares in any way to a formal betrothal, of course. Not in the slightest.~
@647  = ~Or any betrothal, for that matter.~
@648  = ~At all.~
@649  = ~No, it doesn't. I think our relationship is considerably more special than that.~
@650  = ~I think it is time you stopped measuring your own worth against what you think your parents wanted or what you think Isaea wants, and start being yourself.~
@651  = ~That is because I care for you far more than Isaea, or any man, ever could.~
@652  = ~And what is stopping us? I would gladly ask your hand from your aunt, in lieu of your rightful parents.~
@653  = ~It... well, of course. Our partnership has been one we made willingly, not because someone expected it of us. And... that is rather special, you're right.~
@654  = ~I should let you get back to your own thinking, <CHARNAME>. We can talk more later.~
@655  = ~Trust me, <CHARNAME>. "Being myself" is something I have never had any problem with. Much to the frustration of just about everyone responsible for me, at some point or another.~
@656  = ~But I appreciate that you see it as a boon as much as I.~
@657  = ~That... that...~
@658  = ~I mean to say that Isaea will never love anything more than the sound of his own voice, the heft of his purse and the length of his social register.~
@659  = ~Oh! No, no, nothing like that is required, <CHARNAME>. We have already achieved our goals without that sort of politics. Isaea will just have to sit and stew. He can boil until he burns, for all I care.~
@660  = ~That is a very unfair remark, <CHARNAME>. My father was wrong--I admit that much--but it would also be wrong to let all the good he did be blotted out by a tragic mistake made in a state of anguish. I will certainly not allow it.~
@661  = ~As you say, Nalia.~
@662  = ~Of course. Forgive the jibe.~
@663  = ~Think what you like. I think it was shameful.~
@664  = ~And I do not wish to further discuss our... difference of opinion on this matter.~
@665  = ~That wasn't true, what I said to Isaea. That he had taken everything I loved.~
@666  = ~I mean, of course, that he was unsuccessful in his plan to take the Keep and my father's lands. I should not have given him the satisfaction of hearing how much he hurt me all the same, but I suppose it matters little now.~
@667  = ~I thought you said you were never going to think of Isaea again.~
@668  = ~Oh. I hoped you had meant... me. That he hadn't taken me from you, I mean.~
@669  = ~He didn't take away your will to fight, either. It took a lot of courage to seek me out in that tavern and sign me up to fight with you.~
@670  = ~Tyr's sake, woman, will you do nothing but bemoan your old wounds?~
@671  = ~Perhaps I have been too open with my feelings in the wrong company, then. I hardly feel I deserve such rude treatment, however.~
@672  = ~I did say that, didn't I? It seems that it is not that simple. So much of my life is connected to what he brought under siege. My mind wanders and I simply cannot help but see his face.~
@673  = ~You? But Isaea was never interested in you, he wanted me so that he could--oh, I... I see.~
@674  = ~I... of course, I am pleased to still have companions and friends around me. Isaea was too much a coward to take on more than one of us at a time. As I said, I exaggerated and should not have done so.~
@675  = ~I have never been afraid to stand up for what I believe in, or to ask questions. Father welcomed them, and Burwood positively demanded them. "Intelligent questions are the greatest proof of the evolved brain," Burwood said.~
@676  = ~I knew time was short. I would have come to the defense if it were only the larder under attack. But I thought it would be suicide to barge in unaccompanied and... unprepared.~
@677  = ~The entire experience was a terrible reminder of how precarious our comforts are.~
@678  = ~I never knew how easy it could be to lose the people and places you value until it was almost too late.~
@679  = ~The poor beggars in the gutter may not have had their ancestral homes overrun by trolls and powerful mages, but their calamities seem no less severe, I am certain. I know that I am fortunate that we mitigated the situation before all was lost.~
@680  = ~Some look on the Keep as a symbol of wealth or status, and see it only for the treasures it guards and the taxes it collects. But those material things are just a necessary consequence of its true meaning.~
@681  = ~I take great comfort from the stone walls, and the fact that it is so very solid and so very real. It is a symbol of what my ancestors built and a source of comfort for the people of the land, for they know that there is always someone there for them, who will catch them should they fall. Much like... 
Well. It is good to have someone to turn to, in any case, and my proud obligation to carry on that de'Arnise tradition.~
@682  = ~It is a tradition I am proud to have a stake in.~
@683  = ~I love you when you pontificate, lady de'Arnise.~
@684  = ~Obligation? When will you learn to enjoy and embrace the power you earn and wield?~
@685  = ~I hope we do right by everyone. Gorion taught me many things, but how to play at "dukes and duchesses" wasn't one of them. I could still foul things up.~
@686  = ~Let us think of it as our new, enlightened approach to an old tradition, and one forged under most unusual circumstances. And one that is coming to have some most unexpected... possibilities, if I may say so.~
@687  = ~Ha! Such formality! And will you love me when I prognosticate and prevaricate as well, good sir?~
@688  = ~That... that is, do you--oh, never mind.~
@689  = ~Power IS obligation, <CHARNAME>. There is no meaningful difference, except to tyrants and "noble" thieves. I had hoped you would realize that by now.~
@690  = ~I think we have both done well, considering the difficult circumstances. It has been much easier to do so together than it would have been apart. And I will not soon forget your understanding.~
@691  = ~My parents loved one another, you know.~
@692  = ~I am sure they did, Nalia. What brings this on?~
@693  = ~Back off. I never said they didn't.~
@694  = ~Feeling a little defensive about something, are we?~
@695  = ~You do not sound totally convinced.~
@696  = ~Of course I am.~
@697  = ~Very well. You can keep your misconceptions, for all it matters.~
@698  = ~Not in the least.~
@699  = ~I simply want to be sure you have no misconceptions about my family. Knowing the situation between Isaea and me as you do, perhaps you might think it was the same between Father and Mother. But I assure you, nothing could be further from the truth.~
@700  = ~Father had his choice of suitable matches. The story goes that the family was concerned he would not marry of his own accord, so Delcia--never shy about offering her opinion--took it upon herself to meet with five of the most promising young ladies at court, those with the best connections and family prospects for improving our position.~
@701  = ~Four were as you would expect them to be--polite, proper, respectable. The fifth greeted Delcia in her sitting room, asked to be excused for a moment, and left poor Aunty just sitting there. She didn't return for three days. Needless to say, Aunty's report was not favorable.~
@702  = ~When she told my father what she learned, he knew what he wanted. He rode at once to find the young woman who turned the tables on Aunty. Scandalous rumor has it that he found her sneaking out a battlement window dressed in burglar's black. I can only imagine what they spoke of that evening, but I do know that they were married the next day.~
@703  = ~I find that just astonishingly romantic. Don't you?~
@704  = ~That is a beautiful story to remember them by, Nalia.~
@705  = ~Sounds like your father just wanted to rebel against what was expected of him. Not unlike his daughter.~
@706  = ~Very impulsive and romantic, yes, but is it love?~
@707  = ~It is still an arranged marriage by any other name. He chose from a list of society ladies. That's not in the least bit romantic.~
@708  = ~Very inspiring and romantic. Why don't we follow their example, Nalia? Let's get married, right now!~
@709  = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>.~
@710  = ~It's odd, I do not believe I have ever had a friend whom I have told the tale to. Some of my father's older servants knew it, of course, and Burwood knew my mother even before my father took her hand, so he had HIS version of the tale. But I have never heard it from my own lips.~
@711  = ~My father always made his own decisions, <CHARNAME>. He heard of the woman that he knew would be perfect for him--and he was right. I admire them both, and always shall.~
@712  = ~What is love, if it is not finding what you need?~
@713  = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>, really! You needn't flatter me so. Our situations are quite different now. Our concern is not just putting a good face forward to the people of the Arnise lands, but to fight for all the downtrodden in Amn!~
@714  = ~Even if we were to... that is, even if such a thing would be appropriate, it would be such a distraction!~
@715  = ~It... it does make me wonder, sometimes, just what Isaea and his men meant, that my father had given in to them. He had always told me I could delay Isaea as long as I wished, and that we had forged the alliance simply to keep their aggression at bay.~
@716  = ~Perhaps my father hoped I would follow his example and render Isaea's claim moot by finding another. Perhaps...~
@717  = ~Oh. Never mind me, <CHARNAME>. I am just a little lost in my thoughts. I will be fine.~
@718  = ~My thoughts, I must admit, are still very much on Isaea and the things we heard before he died. His aide said, "Arnise had already given in, he pledged his daughter." But that's impossible! My father would never have conspired with the Roenalls. It's unthinkable! It's... it's slander!~
@719  = ~I agree, one hundred percent. And he has paid for his insult.~
@720  = ~Does it really matter? The only thing that mattered is whether or not you would go through with it, and it sounds like you would have sooner died than marry a Roenall.~
@721  = ~Are you sure? He *did* pledge your hand to them. Is that not exactly what they wanted?~
@722  = ~Shall we have the man resurrected so you can challenge him to a duel of honor, then?~
@723  = ~Face it, Nalia. You are a pawn in the game of land and titles, and you were going to be sacrificed in the name of peace and prosperity.~
@724  = ~Nalia, let it go. The only person who is still alive and cares about this betrothal you didn't want is you. It's over and done with.~
@725  = ~That is not in the least bit amusing, <CHARNAME>! This is a very serious matter!~
@726  = ~Get over yourself, fathead. You play the role men tell you to play. Now be quiet and get back in line.~
@727  = ~My apologies. I was just trying to show you that it was no longer a problem.~
@728  = ~I do not believe I appreciate your tone, <CHARNAME>. I am no pawn and I will not be treated as such.~
@729  = ~I know that, Nalia, and I never would do such a thing to you, but I fear you were being used. The fact remains that your father agreed to a marriage you wanted no part of.~
@730  = ~Then wise up and stop believing others act in your best interest.~
@731  = ~Forgive me, but I feel no joy over his passing, vile though his insinuations were.~
@732  = ~I will not be addressed in that manner! I see you are little different than the Roenalls and their ilk. Good riddance to you!~
@733  = ~I shall. Beginning right now.~
@734  = ~You needn't be so brusque. I am not a child and I do not need such reminders. I merely seek your counsel.~
@735  = ~Knowing what I know now, absolutely. I can only suspect that he meant to do away with me as soon as appearances allowed, had we not learned the true blackness of his nature as we did.~
@736  = ~I had thought it over and done with, but now I find I cannot stop that man's words from swimming through my head in most unpleasant fashion. I cannot quiet him. I cannot shut out his insinuations.~
@737  = ~It is not the retainer's attitude which concerns me, it is his meaning. He could not know we were listening. So why would he say such a thing unless... unless there were some shred of truth to it?~
@738  = ~Nonsense. You know your father's mind far better than some Roenall retainer. The Duke beat the Roenalls at their own game, so Isaea changed the rules and attacked outright. We have repaid that treachery as best we can, and honored your father in so doing.~
@739  = ~Perhaps there is. Your father did pledge your hand to the Roenalls.~
@740  = ~Your father is dead. We cannot ask him for more clarity. You will have to make up your own mind as to the truth of the matter.~
@741  = ~Of course there was. Would there not have been serious repercussions at court if the Roenalls pressed their claim and you refused to take Isaea's hand? Would not the Roenalls have claimed damages?~
@742  = ~I am bored of this discussion, Nalia. Isaea is dead. You belong to no one. Let's move on, shall we?~
@743  = ~I suppose I must. How I loathe these court games, these conspiracies of land and title. My father did his best his whole life to rise above them, and I hate the Roenalls for slinging their mud at him and creating this entire mess.~
@744  = ~He did, but he always made it clear to me that I could refuse Isaea as long as I wished--that we merely needed the appearance of an alliance, and that it never need lead to more than letting Isaea spin me on the dance floor in front of the right people at court once in a while.~
@745  = ~Wretched though that was, it was hardly too much for my father to ask of me.~
@746  = ~You both did what you had to do in a very delicate situation. Trust your instincts, Nalia, which I know tell you that your father loved you too much to give you to a "complete bastard."~
@747  = ~What if your father came to you and told you that your family's survival depended on cementing the union--not just playing at it? Would you have agreed then?~
@748  = ~I never bought that story, Nalia. One doesn't promise a noble marriage and a merging of lands, then say "we were just kidding" without severe consequences.~
@749  = ~You're right, <CHARNAME>. That is what my heart tells me.~
@750  = ~To Hades with the insinuations of Isaea's cretinous underlings! My father was a good and just man, and they took terrible advantage of him and placed him in a dreadful bind. I only wish he could have lived to see it unwound with your aid.~
@751  = ~Yes... there might well have been serious damage had the Roenalls pressed ahead and claimed damage from my refusal. But we were hoping they would go away and find someone else to bother! It was simply a delaying tactic! It... it...~
@752  = ~Face facts, Nalia. You would be Lady Isaea Roenall if your father had had his way. They were all just waiting for you to tire of resisting so they could seal their deal.~
@753  = ~You do not need to convince me of anything, Nalia. I cannot help you find peace with this, you will have to make up your own mind.~
@754  = ~Shhhhhh... Nalia, relax! I imagine your father simply wanted to bide time and build up his defenses against an inevitable Roenall invasion. It was not a bad strategy. Isaea simply took unfair advantage.~
@755  = ~I see you have worked it out for yourself. I have nothing more to add.~
@756  = ~You can't know that! My father was a good and just man! He fought his entire life to rise above these damnable games of land and power to do good for his people! He... he...~
@757  = ~I do not believe I wish to discuss this any further, <CHARNAME>.~
@758  = ~Oh, what's the use in any of this? Isaea took so much from me, I'll not have him take my father's memory as well!~
@759  = ~There is nothing I would not have done for my father, and nothing he would not do for me!~
@760  = ~It... it hardly matters now. Isaea was not even half the sack of manure we thought he was, and I am sure the full truth of his abhorrent activities would have been revealed before anything untoward happened between us.~
@761  = ~I... I think it best that we move on now. Thank you, <CHARNAME>, for listening.~
@762  = ~Hmph. I find your lack of courtesy very distasteful at times, <CHARNAME>. Perhaps we shall have to work on that, if you are to help oversee my father's legacy properly.~
@763  = ~You have been admirably attentive towards me during this very trying time. I had never hoped to find a trusted counsel when I sought a likely group of adventurers to fight the Keep's invaders. I merely wished to hire strong arms and sound tactics and be done with the entire affair.~
@764  = ~Things are so very different now, though, aren't they? Between us, I mean.~
@765  = ~It would be nothing but schoolgirl foolishness to think that there is some great destiny at work. But I consider myself most fortunate to have met someone as resourceful and reliable as you, with greater understanding of my needs than I could have thought possible.~
@766  = ~Never underestimate the power of destiny, Nalia. I know I have one, and I believe you do as well... and I believe we have one together.~
@767  = ~It's the sort of thought I would expect from a foolish schoolgirl. You still have a lot to learn, Nalia.~
@768  = ~The pleasure is all mine, Nalia. I live to serve.~
@769  = ~You came into my life at just the right moment as well. I needed a friend, and a reminder of the value of compassion.~
@770  = ~I don't believe in destiny, Nalia. I believe in dedication, devotion... and love.~
@771  = ~And here I thought *I* was behaving like a hopeless romantic!~
@772  = ~Do I? And do you feel it your place to educate me so impertinently?~
@773  = ~I do. Watch your tongue or I'll give you a spanking. (wink)~
@774  = ~I do. You are still painfully immature.~
@775  = ~It was a poor choice of words, Nalia, forgive me.~
@776  = ~By choice? Or by destiny?~
@777  = ~I am glad you look at our meeting in such a positive light. And I am more than happy to have provided you with my guidance and insight, despite the tragic circumstances.~
@778  = ~You... you do?~
@779  = ~That is, I feel much as you do. About the role of destiny.~
@780  = ~Oh, be serious. <CHARNAME>, you are quite incorrigible. I simply don't know what to do with you!~
@781  = ~Then perhaps I should only share my thoughts with others of similar status!~
@782  = ~I don't know that I believe in destinies, <CHARNAME>.~
@783  = ~At least, for myself. I have seen enough to know that you are sometimes pushed by forces you cannot control because of who... who you are.~
@784  = ~It would be irresponsible for me to give credit or blame to forces I cannot control. Far better, I believe, to do what we must to improve the situations we find ourselves in, and celebrate when those actions lead us to happier conclusions that we would have enjoyed without them.~
@785  = ~And our time together has certainly made me feel quite... quite different than I have before.~
@786  = ~I care for you, as well. And I'm not afraid to speak it plainly.~
@787  = ~Where's your sense of romance and wonder? It took a million billion coincidences to bring us together, and just one could have kept us apart. If that is not destiny, I don't know what is.~
@788  = ~Of course you believe in destiny. Is that not the foundation of the social classes?~
@789  = ~Before you say anything you might regret, Nalia... you understand that we are together merely for mutual convenience, do you not?~
@790  = ~I do not believe in happy endings. Every passing day is a trial and we are lucky to survive it. Take what comfort you can, but I'll not join you in wishing for a brighter tomorrow.~
@791  = ~That is the way of the universe, constant change. Which changes are making you so uncomfortable?~
@792  = ~And I would not doubt your sincerity, <CHARNAME>. Not now, after I have trusted you with so much and seen that you have not misused it.~
@793  = ~But I fear this conversation is proving a great distraction to our many responsibilities. Those must take precedence.~
@794  = ~How can I surrender my decisions to destiny? Even magic is something I can feel and control, but the will of some unseen force? No... I could never do that. It would be denying everything I know I must be.~
@795  = ~Those are circumstances of birth, not some grand design. That is what I think of when I think of destiny--events set in motion by something greater than what we are. I can touch magic and control it. I can't say the same for whatever destiny might be.~
@796  = ~Of... of course I do. Yes. A civil, proper partnership of mutual benefit. One that will endure so long as we both observe the rules of good conduct and pay proper attention to our respective responsibilities. I am well aware of my debts to you. You needn't remind me.~
@797  = ~We... yes, yes, of course I do.~
@798  = ~That... that being the case, <CHARNAME>, I believe that there may have been some misunderstandings between us in the past, or at least some hints of impropriety. I am quite certain we will both do our parts now to ensure that they are never repeated.~
@799  = ~I'm troubled by your attitude. I would sooner believe that we were brought together for some greater purpose than believe there is no meaning and no hope for those whose lives I know we can change.~
@800  = ~I would call it familiarity, but I know that is not the right word. It... I could not say what it is, <CHARNAME>. I don't want anything to come between what we must do for the good of others.~
@801  = ~<CHARNAME>, I have a rather impertinent question for you.~
@802  = ~When you were in Candlekeep, did you study much of the discourse on the human question? Do you believe that we are indeed the "young" race and merely a footnote in history, or do you feel there is something deeper and lasting to our culture?~
@803  = ~Is this another "destiny" question? I am tired of this line of discussion.~
@804  = ~I think humanity is the glue holding the Realms together, making it stronger, and helping it to grow far beyond what it could have accomplished without us.~
@805  = ~I don't see that one race of people is any greater than another. Humans have built much in a relatively short period of time, but there are still plenty of things we don't know that the other races have mastered.~
@806  = ~Humanity is a blight. Living fast, dying hard, taking everything and everyone else down in its wake.~
@807  = ~Considering my unique origins, I don't really feel "human."~
@808  = ~It does not have to be if you do not wish it to be. I was merely curious if you had studied the matter.~
@809  = ~That is an interesting view, and one I believe I agree with.~
@810  = ~Very true, <CHARNAME>. But that rapid growth has been our great strength and has opened many doors, has it not?~
@811  = ~That is a disquieting view, although I certainly see that there are enough examples of such behavior to justify certain fears.~
@812  = ~Yes, I imagine that rather creates doubt in your mind. But you shouldn't let it distract you, <CHARNAME>. You may be unique, but having lived most of your life only knowing your humanity, surely you can relate?~
@813  = ~My tutors were constantly insisting on filling my head with the most controversial and contradictory tracts they could get their hands on. I suspect Father was behind it, as he would often engage me in discussion about our role in society--not just as an example to our noble peers and our dependent serfs, but to *all* people, everywhere.~
@814  = ~I believe he felt humans have a unique opportunity to accomplish what the older races could not--a decent, caring, benevolent society not just for one city in the sea or the clouds or the mountains, but to cover the world.~
@815  = ~He felt, and I still feel, that such a world must start in our own lives and in our own lands if it is ever to be realized.~
@816  = ~You are both hopeless optimists. Humanity is the story of "every man for himself," and the sooner you learn that, the better.~
@817  = ~I could phrase it no more nobly myself. I am proud to play whatever small part I can in helping you continue that legacy.~
@818  = ~I agree with your sentiment but not your methods, Nalia. You see two humanities--those who must be saved, and those who must do the saving. I see us as one people, doing the best we can.~
@819  = ~This is all entirely too philosophical for me.~
@820  = ~Humanity grows stronger through conflict, not charity. You need look no further than our accomplishments to see that.~
@821  = ~Then we are of two entirely different minds on the subject, <CHARNAME>. And I must say that disappoints me.~
@822  = ~It makes me proud to know that you would embrace that calling , as I have. Our voices joined together could accomplish great things in the times ahead, I am sure of it. And I thank you for your candor.~
@823  = ~One people, but many different lives and different needs, <CHARNAME>. I feel it would be a disservice to the unfortunate to dismiss their special needs as though they have had the same opportunities as you or me.~
@824  = ~I do not believe deceiving myself will help any of us achieve more equality and understanding. But, I do appreciate your candor.~
@825  = ~I would never suggest there is not a time to rise up in arms and strike a blow. But we must never abandon those whose only failing is that they are too weak of body or spirit to defend themselves! Nor should the conflicts that advance our own goals cause undue hardship to others.~
@826  = ~Besides, if we put a sword instead of a plow in every farmer's hand, what would the world come to? Some must still reap and sow while we fight the good fight, <CHARNAME>. But, I do appreciate your candor.~
@827  = ~I simply hoped to learn more about you, <CHARNAME>.~
@828  = ~As a member of both the elven and human communities, do you feel responsible to both?~
@829  = ~I have seen that you understand and respect human traditions, but what of your other kin? Do you feel pressured by the mandates of the elven race as well?~
@830  = ~I was raised as a human, by a human. Human culture is really all I know, and all I ever wish to know.~
@831  = ~I greatly regret that I had little grounding in the fairer culture, growing up. I hope to become much closer to the elven community in time.~
@832  = ~Nalia, I don't even know which of my parents was an elf... or if I truly am half-elven at all. I feel very little connection to either community.~
@833  = ~I try to respect the uniqueness of both my human and my elven heritage. Why do you ask?~
@834  = ~I feel the pressure of a huge headache named "Nalia." Leave me be.~
@835  = ~Why? Because who we are is so very much guided by how we are born, after all. And I have never been... close... to anyone of elven extraction before.~
@836  = ~I had hoped you might tell me how it affects your view of the world, of equality and understanding... and of bearing the heavy responsibilities of two cultures.~
@837  = ~I don't feel responsible to the whole of humanity and elvenkind, Nalia. I just do the best I can.~
@838  = ~It is a challenging burden, but hardly the most difficult I have had to overcome.~
@839  = ~Who I am has very little to do with the fact that my ears are slightly pointed. Why can't you respect that?~
@840  = ~I don't care about that part of it, Nalia. I wish to embrace the beauty of elven culture, not find out how they divide a roast pig.~
@841  = ~The elves were nowhere to be found when I was abandoned. Gorion saved me and raised me. That tells me all I need to know about humanity and elvenkind.~
@842  = ~Of course. Forgive my wandering.~
@843  = ~No, I should say not. I am confident you will continue to make both sides of your nature work for you, and hopefully, in time, come to a fuller understanding of what each community needs from you. I will be delighted to see that.~
@844  = ~If you insist. I knew it was a personal question, but I wished to understand you better. No matter, then.~
@845  = ~What a shame, <CHARNAME>. Who we are is so very much guided by how we are born, after all.~
@846  = ~Perhaps, perhaps. There are a great many things I could learn from a deeper understanding of humans and elves.~
@847  = ~Do I look like I have time to discover my inner elf? Even wishing for it will not make it so.~
@848  = ~I would be delighted to see that, <CHARNAME>. I would also like to learn more about elven society, and how they address basic inequalities in the distribution of goods and wealth.~
@849  = ~If I get to know the elves, it won't be so that you can add ammunition to your quiet revolution, Nalia. It will be for my purposes and my benefit, understood?~
@850  = ~I doubt very much that their system would work for us. Humans, and even my kind, are too motivated by mortality to see beyond their immediate needs, as elvenkind does.~
@851  = ~Maybe we can be a bridge between the cultures. I would like that.~
@852  = ~Oh, very well. I was merely curious.~
@853  = ~You may be right, <CHARNAME>, but I wish to test that for myself.~
@854  = ~My father felt, and I still feel, that a more equal, more caring world must start in our own lives and in our own lands if it is ever to be realized. We could learn a great deal about moving in that happy direction from the elves, I believe.~
@855  = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>! Your analogies are so delightful. I am certain there will be plenty of time to learn elven culture and art, but it would be a great misuse of the opportunity not to delve into the successes they have had fighting oppression and inequality over more millenia than humans have!~
@856  = ~But I am quite sure we will make time. Thank you.~
@857  = ~As would I.~
@858  = ~That seems so limiting. Why not embrace the other side of your family as well? I am quite certain you would have a great deal to learn from one another.~
@859  = ~Perhaps, perhaps. There are a great many things I could learn from them.~
@860  = ~I do! I never meant to imply that you must act as everyone else with elven blood acts... merely that you might benefit from greater perspective, and that you have more access than most to an interesting world that is not our own.~
@861  = ~But, if those are your wishes, then I respect them. I simply suggest that you be careful about discarding your unique opportunities.~
@862  = ~I should like to see that, <CHARNAME>. Just think what we might accomplish if everyone were so willing to embrace their full potential!~
@863  = ~No, of course not, we have a great deal of important work ahead of us. But I should like to help you make time for such an exploration some day.~
@864  = ~I see your mind is made up, then. I never meant to imply that you must act as everyone else with elven blood acts... merely that you might benefit from greater perspective, and have more access than most to an interesting world that is not our own.~
@865  = ~I have known dwarves, some quite well--such as Bonchy, whom you met. You are... you are somehow different from them, but it took me some time to puzzle out exactly how.~
@866  = ~Why do you not have the accent so many other dwarves have? Is it because you were raised in Candlekeep, rather than in a dwarven community?~
@867  = ~I suppose so. I never really thought about it... but, yes, I learned everything I know of language from Gorion and the monks, so I suppose I sound like them.~
@868  = ~Nay! I've tha self-same accent as any load o' mountain-dwellers ye like! I just hoard it fer the occasional lass who can appreciate me earthy tones!~
@869  = ~Don't you like me as I am? Do I have to be like every other dwarf you know to earn your approval?~
@870  = ~That was a stupid question, Nalia, even by your standards.~
@871  = ~Of course. That explains a great many things. I am surprised it too me so long to realize, and I am glad you are not offended.~
@872  = ~No, of course not, <CHARNAME>. I appreciate you very much for who you are. I certainly did not mean to cause you any discomfort!~
@873  = ~I... am not accustomed to being spoken to in that manner, <CHARNAME>. Especially not by someone whom I... whom I might... oh, never mind.~
@874  = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>, that's delightful! Wonderful! Thank you!~
@875  = ~Would... no, that would be imposing far too much.~
@876  = ~Would you say a few more words for me?~
@877  = ~I'm not your performing dog, Nalia. Like I said, I keep it in reserve for special occasions.~
@878  = ~O' course, girlie. Aye, I've nothin' against tellin' a fine lass a tale or two about me gold an' me best shinin' hammer. Now, enough talk, I've a powerful thirst fer a draught o' strong dwarven ale!~
@879  = ~Why? What do I get in return? Your impression of an overbearing ogre? Again?~
@880  = ~If I do, will you blow in my ear?~
@881  = ~Very well, <CHARNAME>. I respect that.~
@882  = ~I... I do not believe I see the connection, <CHARNAME>. But... perhaps if it is something especially...~
@883  = ~Oh, goodness, this is becoming entirely too silly and it is my fault. Please forget I said anything.~
@884  = ~Do you feel that living among humans has unfairly limited your understanding of your racial heritage? I refer to more than just a dialect, of course. Living within and beneath the earth, learning the dwarven ways... did Candlekeep deprive you of these things? Do you wish to learn more?~
@885  = ~Nay, those bellyachin' monks were pleased enough ta let me dig a tunnel hither an' yon when the mood did strike me. Worked up a powerful thirst fer strong dwarven ale doin' so, I did.~
@886  = ~It did, but where were "my people" when I needed them? Gorion saved me and raised me. That's more important to me than any racial inheritance from people I barely know.~
@887  = ~Yes! Those damn longlimbs made me into one of them! I'm a disgrace of a dwarf!~
@888  = ~I had plenty of opportunity to study the history and lifestyle of my people, and that has well-prepared me to encounter them in the real world.~
@889  = ~I am pleased to hear it. You have been given unique perspective into two very different worlds, <CHARNAME>. I envy that opportunity.~
@890  = ~You needn't look at it so negatively, <CHARNAME>! I am quite certain that your unique perspective would be seen as a great asset to many dwarves. And, although current conditions are not favorable, there should still be time to learn their ways and mores when events settle.~
@891  = ~Why, I'm sure Bonchy would just love to... oh, but I do go on about the silliest things. Never mind.~
@892  = ~I never meant to imply that you must act as everyone else with dwarven blood acts... merely that you might benefit from greater perspective, and that you have more access than most to an interesting world that is not our own.~
@893  = ~<CHARNAME>, you are positively too much fun. Thank you for giving me a smile I shall carry all day.~
@894  = ~"Strong dwarven ale," indeed!~
@895  = ~Your blood is elven, is it not? Yet you were raised by a human, among human children, and travel mostly in human circles.~
@896  = ~What of your other kin? Do you feel pressured by the mandates of the elven race as well? Will you someday leave human society behind to join them?~
@897  = ~I feel very little connection to either community.~
@898  = ~Who I am has very little to do with the fact that my ears are pointed. Why can't you respect that?~
@899  = ~No? Surely you must realize the uniqueness of your position. If you live life as a human, you could witness a score of your friends' lifetimes. And if you live it among the elves, you can bring them unprecedented insight into our ways, having been raised as any human boy might.~
@900  = ~Do you not feel drawn to learn what they know, or how they might need your special abilities and insight?~
@901  = ~Are you trying to get rid of me? I thought you enjoyed my company.~
@902  = ~I do feel a certain emptiness, a certain sadness... perhaps it is my disconnection from the elves causing it. I will have to think on this.~
@903  = ~Well, of course I do. I simply wish to better understand what guides you... what obligations you must follow beyond those you have made to your companions and to the people of my lands. And I wanted you to know that I understand the call you may feel from your people. I certainly would not wish to lose... well.~
@904  = ~Thank you for explaining, <CHARNAME>.~
@905  = ~I suspected that might be the case, <CHARNAME>. While I cannot help you better understand the elven spirit, I think you should know that I strongly support you if ever you need a... a leave of absence to pursue these feelings. Not that I wish to lose your company, of course.~
@906  = ~I would never wish to minimize you based on appearances. I merely hoped to understand what motivates you better, and what factors may demand your attention someday.~
@907  = ~I have always known that I would always belong to my family's lands, and to Amn. It is where I was born, and where I am meant to be, I am certain.~
@908  = ~But you have no such ties. You could be swept anywhere by adventure and circumstance. Perhaps back to Candlekeep, perhaps to the ends of the world.~
@909  = ~But considering what has come between us, I feel that I must know... how deep is your commitment? To... to the Keep, I mean. To this land.~
@910  = ~I will be here as long as you would have me, Nalia. I promised to aid you with the Keep, and that is exactly what I will do until you tell me otherwise.~
@911  = ~I was actually just waiting for a good moment to tell you that I have grown tired of your petty politics. Find another sucker to push around your serfs.~
@912  = ~Is that really what you want to know about, Nalia? The Keep? Or are you asking me something else?~
@913  = ~I learned the hard way not to get too attached to any one place. We spared your Keep once, yes, so enjoy it while it lasts.~
@914  = ~My destiny is a powerful and unpredictable one. You're right. Excitement and danger could take me anywhere, at any time.~
@915  = ~My commitment to you is unflinching, Nalia. Not just to your lands, but to you.~
@916  = ~Of course, <CHARNAME>. You gave your word, and I respect that. But you could find yourself called elsewhere, by forces neither you nor I can control. Or you might find that the life of a landlord is not to your liking.~
@917  = ~I... I see. Of course. I quite clearly misjudged your commitment to a great many things. You'll not need to worry about the Keep much longer, I am certain.~
@918  = ~Your pessimism can be quite daunting at times, <CHARNAME>. I know the harsh realities that can befall my home and my loved ones all too well. But that does not mean I am resigned to such calamity coming again.~
@919  = ~Do you see our time together in the same fashion? Is it best that companions... not grow too attached?~
@920  = ~I feel... I feel I have waited a lifetime to hear you speak such words, <CHARNAME>.~
@921  = ~But why? With so many choices, why would you bind your future to me?~
@922  = ~I may as well admit it to you, Nalia. I am hopelessly in love with you, and could never leave you behind. No matter where I go, I want you with me.~
@923  = ~Because I want you to give me some real power. Put your neighbors on notice that the de'Arnise lands are strong, that we are not victims. I want to raise an army and build a buffer zone so that what happened to your father can never happen to us.~
@924  = ~Because I am hoping to meet a lovely girl who tells me she wants nothing more than for me to stay with her. With chestnut hair, and eyes to match... seen any around?~
@925  = ~Because you get yourself into so much trouble, you need a sensible man around to keep an eye on you.~
@926  = ~Oh, indeed, do I?~
@927  = ~I suppose you have rescued me from more than a normal girl's share of predicaments.~
@928  = ~It... it was not the explanation I had hoped for, but I appreciate your honesty, <CHARNAME>.~
@929  = ~I could not even begin to argue that with you. Until you, the only men of destiny I had met were those born to some House on some certain day which made them feel they were entitled to oppress and swindle their people.~
@930  = ~But you... yes, there are certainly great and powerful forces converging wherever you are. I feel it.~
@931  = ~But I don't believe any destiny is immutable. There are more important things, more lasting things one can build and fight for than a plan someone else may have written before he was even born.~
@932  = ~Do you think there is anything that might make you fight that hard?~
@933  = ~I... I don't know, Nalia. Do you think there is?~
@934  = ~If I felt that you cared about more than just my leadership. If I felt certain that you cared about me, personally, then yes.~
@935  = ~I want some real control. Put your neighbors on notice that the de'Arnise lands are strong, that we are not victims. I want to raise an army and build a buffer zone so that what happened to your father can never happen to us.~
@936  = ~Maybe I will meet a lovely girl who tells me she wants nothing more than for me to stay with her. That might keep me around. With chestnut hair, and eyes to match... seen any around?~
@937  = ~We will just have to see, Nalia. Life is complicated and I am not in the business of making predictions. I am very happy in our current situation. Try to be content with that.~
@938  = ~Is there nothing more that could entice you to stay?~
@939  = ~It is only responsible to think of the future, <CHARNAME>. We depend upon each other, and a great many people depend upon us in turn. I was merely thinking of everyone's best interests.~
@940  = ~The decisions we make, and whether we... whether we stay together, or not, affects a great many people beyond just you and me. I hope that means something to you.~
@941  = ~No, no, no! No, that won't do at all.~
@942  = ~<CHARNAME>, I am... I am completely and utterly shocked that you would even propose such a thing. It is not what we stand for. Not at all!~
@943  = ~I... I shall need a moment to myself.~
@944  = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>, you rogue! You'll snatch my beating heart from my chest if I don't watch myself!~
@945  = ~Good sir, she is me. I do want you to stay with me, and for us to be together.~
@946  = ~Why--well, <CHARNAME>, you know that I appreciate you in many ways, such... such as...~
@947  = ~Oh, there's no point in pretending, is there?~
@948  = ~<CHARNAME>, I... I want you to be with me.~
@949  = ~For more than just the Keep or my people or the consideration you have shown me in my recent troubles. I feel a closeness to you that I have never felt before, and I shan't give it up.~
@950  = ~Oh. That is... that's more than I had ever hoped to hear.~
@951  = ~I want to be with you as well, and to say all the wonderful things you want to hear.~
@952  = ~I simply need more time, <CHARNAME>. Knowing that you... knowing what I know makes it easier.~
@953  = ~This is all rather embarrassing. It would seem that I asked you a question but was not truly prepared for your answer.~
@954  = ~Now you have something to think about. I have every confidence you can decide what to do about it.~
@955  = ~Don't wait too long to decide what to do about it. You never know when the breezes might blow me onto someone else's doorstep.~
@956  = ~That's it? That's all you can say to me?~
@957  = ~Would you like me to change my mind, perhaps say something else?~
@958  = ~Of course not! I hope and trust that you are being honest with me at all times. Don't change that now! I merely wish that I had prepared to say more to you.~
@959  = ~My, <CHARNAME>, such confidence in me. You'll positively turn a girl's head that way!~
@960  = ~That is precisely what I do not want to happen.~
@961  = ~I wouldn't want to say anything in haste that might later haunt us, <CHARNAME>. Please, give me some time with my thoughts.~
@962  = ~Oh, pardon me, was I staring again? I must break myself of that terrible habit.~
@963  = ~You see, I have been studying you, after a fashion. Watching the way you reach your decisions, both in parlay and in battle. I have long been impressed by how accomplished you are for one not born to the position.~
@964  = ~Were you given much formal command training in your youth?~
@965  = ~When I took my oath of service and joined the ranks of the paladins, I had a great deal of education in leadership, yes.~
@966  = ~I have no training and no calling for leadership. Everyone is free to do what they please.~
@967  = ~Oh, surprised, are you? Didn't think one of the little people had it in him?~
@968  = ~Gorion and my other instructors taught me quick-thinking as well as formal command theory, yes. If it has served me well enough to impress you, then it was all worthwhile.~
@969  = ~Gorion tried to make me sit through a lesson on field tactics once. I fell asleep somewhere between higher ground and bannermen.~
@970  = ~I consider myself a diligent student of men and their interactions. Perhaps that is what you see in me.~
@971  = ~I never expected to be a leader, so I have had to learn the hard way, and do the best I can with the situations handed to me.~
@972  = ~You make it sound so formal, Nalia. It's just you and me, after all.~
@973  = ~There is no call for such defensiveness, <CHARNAME>. The skills we are raised to possess have much to do with the social status we are born into. I would hardly expect a cloistered, pampered noble to be a natural fisherman or an efficient hog slaughterer, either, if it pleases you to hear it.~
@974  = ~Of course, of course. That explains a great many things. You would have received special training.~
@975  = ~I don't simply mean the communication between the two of us. I am referring to the way you deal with others, friend or foe.~
@976  = ~It does. Although I am not so self-centered as to think that is the reason you were such a good study, <CHARNAME>.~
@977  = ~Ha! Well, no matter, <CHARNAME>. You have acquitted yourself quite well without the classroom work.~
@978  = ~That would be a great benefit, yes. Perhaps that is the best way. Rather than studying how to kill a man or manipulate him, you study the man himself, and then you have the most options of all.~
@979  = ~I know that the unfortunate hardships you have faced were cruel instructors, but you have acquitted yourself quite well without the classroom work.~
@980  = ~It matters little how you have come to be so accomplished a leader. All that matters is that you are.~
@981  = ~It's strange... I remember times, when I was a girl, and I would watch my father hold court, or address our guards or the household staff. I would become absolutely mesmerized by his presence. It was as though he could make time slow to a halt, and draw all eyes to him. I know I was not the only one who felt this way.~
@982  = ~Now that you have his responsibilities, as well as your own, I cannot help but be reminded of him when I see you stand in his place... but I know that with you, it is a different experience, a different style, a different presence.~
@983  = ~When I look upon you, <CHARNAME>, and see you command, I feel... positively electrified.~
@984  = ~I feel shivers down my spine unlike anything I have experienced before. I cannot explain it.~
@985  = ~Oh, listen to me. This all sounds so hopelessly melodramatic, and is hardly a necessary interruption at a time when there are so many counting on us to be focused and decisive.~
@986  = ~So even now, you place your "needy" ones above our feelings? That's hardly fair to us.~
@987  = ~Not at all. It sounds incredibly sweet and romantic.~
@988  = ~I had no idea you looked at me that way, Nalia.~
@989  = ~You flatter me, Nalia. I do not have any of the special gifts you describe. I'm just a man.~
@990  = ~Let me know if you ever desire a tingling sensation in more interesting places.~
@991  = ~Then be decisive and stop dancing around. Tell me what you are really trying to say, Nalia.~
@992  = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>! I absolutely do not know what is worse about you sometimes--your rough edges, or that I find them so delightful.~
@993  = ~I'll never forget my responsibilities and commitments to others, <CHARNAME>. But speaking to you, now, I am not thinking of anyone except you, and me.~
@994  = ~Why... why thank you, <CHARNAME>.~
@995  = ~I admit, I am surprised myself. I never imagined such things could be possible when I spied you across the greasy, smoky air of the Copper Coronet.~
@996  = ~Your modesty is admirable, <CHARNAME>, but hardly necessary. And it changes nothing of how I feel.~
@997  = ~Things have happened so quickly, and even in my wildest dreams of helping people and doing the right thing, I had never conceived of an experience like this... the experiences you have brought to my life.~
@998  = ~I cannot say exactly what it is that I am feeling. I only know that I never want it to stop.~
@999  = ~You are feeling my love for you, Nalia. Plain and simple.~
@1000 = ~Whatever it is, I hope it isn't contagious.~
@1001 = ~When you decide what it is, let me know. But don't take too long. Life is short.~
@1002 = ~I will always be here for you, Nalia. Come what may.~
@1003 = ~I feel the same way you do. I think this is what magic really is.~
@1004 = ~I believe you, <CHARNAME>. I truly do.~
@1005 = ~I think I am rather hoping it is.~
@1006 = ~And our time together is fleeting? Is there nothing worth savoring, worth living for? I suppose we shall see.~
@1007 = ~I... I admit, I have come to take that for granted now, <CHARNAME>. You have been a source of strength and deliverance more than once. I would hate to lose that.~
@1008 = ~Magic... yes. I thought I knew what magic was--the predictable release of energies, invoked by a concentration of energies and materials and directed at a target to a predictable end.~
@1009 = ~This sort of magic is not nearly so predictable, but I believe I find it all the more appealing for that. And I think I am glad it is something we share.~
@1010 = ~You must have found me very forward when first we met. I have never been one to let formality stand in the way of urgency, and the need was urgent indeed.~
@1011 = ~When the crisis passed, I did my best to smooth over the natural barriers that existed between us. I did not want you to feel unworthy or ill-used.~
@1012 = ~Yet now, when I think upon us and our time together, I find such notions foolish. As though there could not possibly have ever been a force in all the world that could keep us apart.~
@1013 = ~Do you feel the same, <CHARNAME>? Or have I taken complete leave of my senses?~
@1014 = ~I have never felt there was a barrier between us, Nalia.~
@1015 = ~I have tried to say as much, Nalia. I love you, in case you have forgotten.~
@1016 = ~This is all happening so fast, Nalia. You have suffered great loss and change. I may just be filling a temporary void in your heart.~
@1017 = ~I cannot say the words you want to hear.~
@1018 = ~The two are not mutually exclusive, my dear. But yes, you are a very natural part of my life now.~
@1019 = ~Of course. You sensed immediately that I needed your help. Kindness is a powerful wedge, <CHARNAME>. I have found that it can stand in the way of a mountain of doubt. And I was fortunate to benefit from your kindness.~
@1020 = ~But I speak not only of barriers of class or of friendship.~
@1021 = ~Of course not. I could do nothing of the sort! The mere fact that you could say such a thing, and that I could hear it and... and accept it, without doubt, without question, is exactly what I mean.~
@1022 = ~Yes, that's it exactly! Against all order, against all design, we have pushed past those natural barriers between us and replaced them with something new.~
@1023 = ~I assure you that what I say, I say only because I feel it is real and lasting. Do not mistake my generosity for easy feelings, <CHARNAME>. My heart is not lightly moved to such proclamations as the one I... I wish to make to you.~
@1024 = ~Can you trust in what I say to you, that I know my own feelings? Or must I abandon these thoughts?~
@1025 = ~I will listen, Nalia.~
@1026 = ~Forgive me. I only wanted to help you avoid rushing into something you might come to regret.~
@1027 = ~Keep it to yourself. In a tenday, you will have forgotten, as the rest of your wounds heal.~
@1028 = ~I think it would be best if you held your peace, Nalia. Let us not complicate our relationship.~
@1029 = ~I do not speak as some sort of wounded gosling! I know what is in my mind and my heart!~
@1030 = ~But I see now that it has made a considerable mistake.~
@1031 = ~Your concern is hardly compelling, <CHARNAME>. I will say what I must.~
@1032 = ~Cannot, after so many words have already passed between us? Or will not?~
@1033 = ~I... I suppose it makes precious little difference now. I have been foolish indeed to distract myself from weightier matters on these frivolous and fruitless exchanges. It is not a mistake I intend to repeat.~
@1034 = ~I feel that we see in each other what we wish to see in ourselves. That we make each other stronger, more understanding, and more sensitive.~
@1035 = ~I no longer wonder where these gifts came from. I know they are yours, and all you ask is that I give you the same in return.~
@1036 = ~I know I feel at ease in a way I never have before, because I can say to you that I love you. I love you, <CHARNAME>.~
@1037 = ~Oh, Nalia. You don't know how dangerous that is.~
@1038 = ~I love you too, Nalia. I feel as you do--we make one another complete.~
@1039 = ~And I love you. Now, and forevermore.~
@1040 = ~I am sorry, Nalia, but I cannot return your feelings. You are a close companion... but I do not, I cannot love you.~
@1041 = ~I... Nalia, I don't know what to say.~
@1042 = ~I'm not a fool. I have taken my share of aches and scars since we met, and I have seen sights and heard of horrors that don't bear repeating right now. I think I know what it means to love you, and I say it is well worth it.~
@1043 = ~Complete? Oh, I certainly hope not. There is so much more to life, so much more that you and I can explore and learn together. We may carry great responsibility today, but this is no time to stop growing.~
@1044 = ~I understand. You will tell me what is in your heart soon enough, I trust.~
@1045 = ~You have taught me a great deal, <CHARNAME>. Men like Isaea could never have shared in the life I have chosen for myself.~
@1046 = ~You showed me that I did not need sacrifice my principles and priorities simply to find caring company--you showed me that the best soulmate is the one we earn by being true to ourselves.~
@1047 = ~You are simply too good to refuse, Nalia. Their loss is my gain.~
@1048 = ~Soulmate... that is an excellent word, a beautiful description of two minds in close harmony. That's exactly how I feel about you, my love.~
@1049 = ~I wouldn't change a thing about you.~
@1050 = ~Who we are changes every day, it seems, but some things, such as what you and I share, are not so mutable. Maybe that's what love really is--constancy in a chaotic world.~
@1051 = ~Honestly, it smacks of a little girl's flight of fancy. Burwood would cringe to know I ever said it.~
@1052 = ~But some flights of fancy are well worth taking.~
@1053 = ~They will never know what they missed. I find that more appealing than is proper, I think.~
@1054 = ~That's a discussion for another time, is it not? Come, <CHARNAME>. We've much to do.~
@1055 = ~I should hope not. Principles, duty, a sense of right and responsibility... those things don't change day by day.~
@1056 = ~I find it quite unnerving, the way memories can change in one's mind. Time, experience... they all seem to color things I once accepted were the most important moments of my life.~
@1057 = ~What stock do you put in memories, <CHARNAME>? Are they for idle, backwards-looking dreamers alone, or do your memories have special meaning to you?~
@1058 = ~I like to remember where the softest bed and the easiest merchant is wherever I have been. Aside from that, I live for today.~
@1059 = ~Surely you jest. My head is positively awash in memories of the places I have been, the joys and horrors I have experienced, of the faces of good friends and dead enemies. They are all special, in their way.~
@1060 = ~Memories are the fuel that makes my unending nightmares burn that much more painfully. I have no use for them.~
@1061 = ~Memories are for old people. This is the time we make them.~
@1062 = ~I am not one to sit and dwell on what was or might have been. I look to the future.~
@1063 = ~Ha! You would have gotten along famously with Burwood. He was rarely fond of remembrance of any sort. He once chased a history tutor out of my room--out of the Keep entirely, in fact--accusing him of being a "worthless, weaselly spouter of the lies of the victors."~
@1064 = ~I imagine his perspective would be rather changed, knowing that he is... is but a memory to me now.~
@1065 = ~Then you are much as I. The sorrow in the faces of the downtrodden, the smile I know I can bring to the face of an urchin... I know that I will carry those memories with me forever.~
@1066 = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>. I did not intend to compound your anguish. I, too, know what it means to carry the look of another's despair and devastation with me for days on end.~
@1067 = ~If only it were so. Perhaps you are more fortunate than I and can push your memories to the back of your mind and save them for leisurely reflection.~
@1068 = ~Of course. I do as well. But where we are going, and the decisions we will make when we get there, are so very much affected by a life of experience.~
@1069 = ~It is so very strange. Had you asked me to name my favorite memory yesterday, or the day before, I would not have hesitated. It was a harvest festival eight years ago, on the day when a representative of each of the hamlets and villages of our lands would raise their flags on the battlements in a show of unity.~
@1070 = ~My father always hoisted the centerpiece banner. But on that day, he passed the honor to me. It was then, for the first time, that I truly appreciated what it meant to be the daughter of a lord. I felt it, in the eyes of every one of our servants and retainers and villagers who watched me work the rope.~
@1071 = ~I think that my father felt it too--that he knew for the first time what he would ask of me one day, in taking up the legacy of his name and his works and carrying on. Without a word, we accepted this, and agreed that it was right. That it would work.~
@1072 = ~When I look back on that day now, however, I feel something different. What we shared in that moment, what we saw in the future, was not what came to be. I survived, the Keep survived, but in the world my father and I saw together that day, the invasion could have never come to pass. That day, that moment between us, is a promise unfulfilled, ended on a cold stone floor in the cellars.~
@1073 = ~On the other hand, for what it means to the new direction my life has taken, I remember our first meeting most fondly. It was not nearly so long ago as the festival, but it has become just as much a part of who I am today. Were it not for your understanding and generosity... well. I should not like to think about that.~
@1074 = ~This must all seem ridiculous to you. Of course it is.~
@1075 = ~You remember it differently than I do, that much is certain.~
@1076 = ~Not at all. It helps me understand you better.~
@1077 = ~Of all the damsels in distress in all the seedy taverns in Amn, why did you have to be the one to stick in my life?~
@1078 = ~You are no different for being struck by tragedy, Nalia. Real change only comes from inside of us.~
@1079 = ~That gives us something else in common, then, for I cannot think of a happier memory than the day we met.~
@1080 = ~This is all needlessly dramatic, yes. Times change, people change. Get over it.~
@1081 = ~Perhaps that says something about the difference in how we interpret our memories, <CHARNAME>.~
@1082 = ~I am glad you are still willing to learn, <CHARNAME>. The best partnerships are forged and maintained through healthy communication.~
@1083 = ~Not that there are not other concerns as well, of course.~
@1084 = ~Perhaps because mine was the greatest need. Or because I had the sharpest sword and the richest lands? Only you can answer that for certain, <CHARNAME>.~
@1085 = ~As much as I wish to believe that, I know too well all the other forces at work. We can fight them--and we should--but denying them accomplishes nothing. Both of those days changed me, <CHARNAME>.~
@1086 = ~You don't put much stock in the power of these memories, then?~
@1087 = ~What do you feel when you think back on that fateful day at the Coronet? If you do not look upon our meeting fondly, now would be a very... appropriate time for you to tell me.~
@1088 = ~I did not realize how important you would become in my life when we first met. But, of course I look upon it fondly.~
@1089 = ~It was a day much like any other. Let's not spoil it through over-analysis, shall we?~
@1090 = ~I take only guilty pleasure in it. Pleasure from meeting you... guilt because our friendship came only on the heels of your personal tragedy.~
@1091 = ~I had no direction, no one to live for, before that day. It is the most important of my entire life.~
@1092 = ~Clearly you are taking our acquaintance far more seriously than I am.~
@1093 = ~I am glad to hear you say that.~
@1094 = ~You are entitled to your opinion, of course. I had hoped to hear something rather more... personable from you.~
@1095 = ~But if that is your heart, I will respect it. Good... good day, then, <CHARNAME>.~
@1096 = ~Thank you for being so kind, <CHARNAME>. Oh, listen to me, it seems I will never stop saying that!~
@1097 = ~I am sure that day means little to everyone else in that smoky, dingy tavern. For us, it will always be something much, much greater.~
@1098 = ~We mustn't lose ourselves in that, <CHARNAME>. I know my father wanted me to live the lessons he taught me, not lose myself in his memory. Doing that is the best way we can honor him. And each other.~
@1099 = ~It was a joyous occasion in a very trying time, and I will always be grateful for what it has meant for me. And what you mean to me.~
@1100 = ~How... how can you stand there and coax me to tell you such things as I have only to reveal now that you care so little for me? You are a rapscallion of the lowest order and I shall not endure you one moment longer!~
@1101 = ~<CHARNAME>, before we rest, I had hoped you could attend me for a moment. There is something I wish to ask you. Of a... personal nature.~
@1102 = ~Yes, Nalia? What is it?~
@1103 = ~I am extraordinarily tired. I'll "attend" you when I wake.~
@1104 = ~I can attend you as long as you like, Nalia. Just say the word.~
@1105 = ~You look pale. Is something wrong?~
@1106 = ~That's... that's for the best, I believe. Sorry to have bothered you.~
@1107 = ~No, nothing is wrong. I have simply been thinking something over.~
@1108 = ~There is something I wish to ask of you, <CHARNAME>.~
@1109 = ~Something... that is... of a personal...~
@1110 = ~That is, should I prepare my spells any differently this evening? Did you have any last-minute suggestions before I open my tomes?~
@1111 = ~Sure, stock up on more offensive magic. We can always use more firepower.~
@1112 = ~Look after taking care of yourself and the party better. We need protection.~
@1113 = ~No, you know best, Nalia.~
@1114 = ~Is that what you really called me over here for? To ask me about spells?~
@1115 = ~Nalia, your hands are trembling. Will you please tell me what's the matter?~
@1116 = ~Thank you for your confidence, <CHARNAME>. I'm glad you trust in me.~
@1117 = ~Very good, <CHARNAME>. I will try to make a note of that, of course.~
@1118 = ~Yes, I... I merely wished to see if you had changed your mind from the last time we discussed it. Open lines of communication are very important between companions, you know that.~
@1119 = ~Nothing! Nothing at all is the matter. I simply have much on my mind. I should not have troubled you, I see that now.~
@1120 = ~Good night, then. I... that is, I hope you will rest well.~
@1121 = ~<CHARNAME>, are you awake? Hello?~
@1122 = ~Of course. I need very little rest. I was just meditating.~
@1123 = ~What? Yes! What?!? Are we under attack?!?~
@1124 = ~Mmmrph. I am now, no thanks to you.~
@1125 = ~I'm getting there. What do you need, my dear?~
@1126 = ~No, no, nothing like that. It is time to be on our way, but that isn't why I woke you.~
@1127 = ~I was not completely open with you last night. There is something on my mind, something rather important, but I believe we can only resolve it back at the Keep.~
@1128 = ~Then we will go immediately.~
@1129 = ~Nalia, we are a little busy with about one hundred other things. Can't I help you with whatever it is here?~
@1130 = ~Well, if you must go, you must go. I understand. I'll be by to collect you when I can.~
@1131 = ~I have really had enough of that place, Nalia. Can we not go a single tenday without having to trudge back there for someone's sob story?~
@1132 = ~Of course, whatever you need, Nalia. But I would just like to say that this is all very cryptic.~
@1133 = ~I think you will understand better once we arrive, and I can explain. You have been ever so patient with me in the past, love.~
@1134 = ~No. Not here, <CHARNAME>. It's important to me that we deal with this matter at the Keep.~
@1135 = ~You don't understand, <CHARNAME>. This... this matter requires the attention of the two of us. And only us.~
@1136 = ~If it is so urgent, why don't you just tell me what it is here and now?~
@1137 = ~Well, I'm not going. Forget it.~
@1138 = ~Ohhhh. Oh. A wink's as good as a nudge. I think I understand now.~
@1139 = ~I think you do, <CHARNAME>. Come, then. Let us make haste to the keep, and not waste any more words.~
@1140 = ~Very well then! I will forget it! I'll try to forget all about it!~
@1141 = ~You.... you... ooooh, you are *such* an infuriatingly dense man sometimes!~
@1142 = ~At last! I thought we would never arrive!~
@1143 = ~<CHARNAME>, I know you may have business with our people, but this matter should not wait another minute. It *cannot* wait another minute.~
@1144 = ~We need to discuss something upstairs. In private. Please, follow me.~
@1145 = ~Lead the way, love.~
@1146 = ~No, no. Allow me to lead.~
@1147 = ~I'm not moving until you tell me just what in the world is so important.~
@1148 = ~You waited this long to tell me, what difference will a few minutes make?~
@1149 = ~Suffice it to say, <CHARNAME>, that it is a matter of great personal concern and delicacy, one ill-suited to the ears of companions and retainers.~
@1150 = ~Now. What is it to be? Will you follow me upstairs, or drag your feet and perhaps never learn of my... intentions?~
@1151 = ~If you put it that way... upstairs, please. I'll keep quiet.~
@1152 = ~What? You mean you want to have sex with me? You dragged me all the way out here just so we could have sex? We could do that anywhere!~
@1153 = ~Forget it, sister. Play your mind games with someone else.~
@1154 = ~Oh. I am a dunce. I see now. Yes, please, lead the way.~
@1155 = ~Hmph! Perhaps I shall be forced to!~
@1156 = ~Now, then, <CHARNAME>. Please allow me to finish this. If I stop, I may not be able to say it again for some time.~
@1157 = ~You know that I have asked a great deal of you, and I have endeavored to show you that it has always been with the purest and, if you will forgive the term, noblest of intentions. And I believe it is on that basis of trust and understanding that we have built a very special relationship, and come to care about one another a great deal.~
@1158 = ~Therefore, after giving this matter considerable thought, I have decided that I would very much like you to make love to me.~
@1159 = ~Right now, if you please.~
@1160 = ~There is nothing in the world I would rather do, my love.~
@1161 = ~Are you quite sure? Does this not violate about eighteen different rules of proper courtship?~
@1162 = ~Nalia, I am truly flattered by your request, but I fear that I must remain chaste. For all I know, my seed could pass along a great evil.~
@1163 = ~This isn't the right time for me, Nalia. I am not comfortable with this.~
@1164 = ~But ours has hardly been a proper courtship, <CHARNAME>. How could it possibly be, all things considered?~
@1165 = ~I have seen proper courtships. I don't want that. I want you.~
@1166 = ~Then that is exactly what you shall have.~
@1167 = ~Nalia, you don't know how long I've waited to hear you say that.~
@1168 = ~I'm sorry, this is entirely too forward. Perhaps some other time, when we are both ready.~
@1169 = ~But I have taken care of that! You have nothing to fear, there will be no unexpected surprises.~
@1170 = ~Please, <CHARNAME>. I am not accustomed to the idea of begging a man to bed me!~
@1171 = ~That's not exactly the only surprise I had in mind. With the taint inside me, I could be compelled to rend you to bits at an awkward moment.~
@1172 = ~Oh, please? Could you at least beg a little?~
@1173 = ~I need to hear you say it. I need to hear you say that you truly understand the risks, and that I cannot always control the things Bhaal placed inside of me.~
@1174 = ~I simply wanted to make sure you were not proposing something you would come to regret. I would be honored to love you, my dear.~
@1175 = ~I understand what it could mean, <CHARNAME>. To be completely honest, it is one of the reasons I could not bring myself to ask this of you the other night. But being with you has always carried with it certain risks. I must embrace them all if I am to embrace you at all.~
@1176 = ~And I do wish to, <CHARNAME>.~
@1177 = ~Please. Come to bed now.~
@1178 = ~Oh, very well! I had hoped you would be more receptive to the thought of a warm, clean bed and an eager lover! I see now that the adage about leading a horse to water is more true than anyone could ever know!~
@1179 = ~Come, my love. Help me forget about everything and everyone in the world but you, if only for a little while.~
@1180 = ~Mmmm... oh, you are already awake? Is something amiss?~
@1181 = ~Not a thing in the world. You are so beautiful when you sleep.~
@1182 = ~No, I was just taking the opportunity to look through your things. Do you still fit in this gown?~
@1183 = ~Nothing at all. I was just wondering why you made us come all the way back here for this. I would have sprung for a clean room at the Coronet if you had asked.~
@1184 = ~My mind always races when I should be resting. It's a curse.~
@1185 = ~Mrrrruh? No, I was still asleep. I guess you wore me out!~
@1186 = ~Yes. Can we get moving now?~
@1187 = ~Why, thank you, <CHARNAME>! I'm very glad you feel that way.~
@1188 = ~Waking to your face is just as pleasant, I assure you. And you gave me most pleasant dreams...~
@1189 = ~Very well.~
@1190 = ~What? Of course I do!~
@1191 = ~I mean, put that down before you get it dirty!~
@1192 = ~Oh, I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>. I'm simply not accustomed to having my personal belongings so exposed. But that gown is so terribly impractical, I cringe to think of an occasion that might warrant wearing it. I far prefer the comfortable traveling garb you and I affect.~
@1193 = ~<CHARNAME>, please! I don't even care to tread barefoot at the Coronet, to say nothing of disrobing more fully.~
@1194 = ~I am quite aware that life is not always what we would command it be for us, but for such an... intimate occasion, I felt it best to have the greatest comforts and the least distractions. I'm sure you agree.~
@1195 = ~It's one of the burdens that comes with great responsibility, I know. Have you any room for thoughts of us?~
@1196 = ~I can think of nothing but you, and how I hope I will never have cause to think of anything or anyone else.~
@1197 = ~I feel ashamed of what we have done. I am supposed to protect you and guide you, not bed you!~
@1198 = ~I do indeed... I am having thoughts of revisiting your bed!~
@1199 = ~My head is such a jumble because my life is constantly pulling me in dozens of directions at once. There is so much to think about.~
@1200 = ~From another, I would think such words flattery... but thank you, <CHARNAME>. I look forward to enjoying the truth in your words.~
@1201 = ~Of course. I could never expect you to forget your duties and think of naught but me in your every waking moment.~
@1202 = ~But people such as you and I need these places of sanctuary and these moments of repose and innocence--to keep from cracking under the strain, you see. That is what I hoped to create for you, and why I wanted our first night together to be here.~
@1203 = ~Mmmm. There was a time I thought you might never rest! When it did come time to slumber, I would have to say it was well-earned.~
@1204 = ~I... I am certain I had not anticipated such curt treatment on such an occasion. Are you quite certain nothing is wrong?~
@1205 = ~No. Nothing. Let's go.~
@1206 = ~This may sound silly, but I've never slept in a bed as comfortable as yours.~
@1207 = ~No, nothing except that I love you.~
@1208 = ~What, no seconds?~
@1209 = ~Is anything else on your mind, love?~
@1210 = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>, how incorrigible! My, I have unleashed something quite insatiable.~
@1211 = ~We've engaged in enough scandal for one day, I believe.~
@1212 = ~There will be plenty of more appropriate opportunities to create more.~
@1213 = ~It's an indulgence, I know, but a necessary one at times.~
@1214 = ~And please... try to think of it as ours. I don't know how often we will be able to return to it, but it is something I look forward to sharing with you again.~
@1215 = ~And I love you as well, <CHARNAME>. I am glad this room, this peace between us helps you to relax. Our moments of calm will by necessity be few and far between, but I am delighted to have shared this one with you.~
@1216 = ~<CHARNAME>, what a curious thing to say! We are of an age, our partnership was practically one of equals and forged under most unusual circumstances to begin with.~
@1217 = ~Honestly, one would think *you* were the blueblood in this relationship! I am quite aware of what certain people would say about the choices we make together, but if I am not concerned, I see no reason at all for you to be!~
@1218 = ~You're right, Nalia. I worried that you might feel I was taking advantage of the circumstances to bed you falsely. I care for you deeply, as a man should care for his lover, not the way a lord cares for property.~
@1219 = ~Maybe your aunt is simply getting to me. She would probably try to have me put to death as a rapist and fornicator.~
@1220 = ~I feel we have abused the form as well as the spirit of propriety, Nalia. I should not have let you lead me here.~
@1221 = ~Nonetheless. I believe our relationship should be strictly professional from now on. This just is not right, and I am sorry I let it progress this far.~
@1222 = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>. I care for you dearly as well. And do not take this poorly, but I am well aware of the difference between being cared for as a lover and as property. Isaea looked upon me as chattel, and I shall never let that happen again.~
@1223 = ~But I need not worry, for I have you, my love.~
@1224 = ~Hmph! Then perhaps you will turn your back while I prepare myself, so as not to violate any more forms!~
@1225 = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>, it won't be so bad as that.~
@1226 = ~Although I would certainly ask you to keep your voice down if we should ever enjoy such an evening again during one of her visits. She might indeed call for the guard! (Nalia winks conspiratorially.)~
@1227 = ~You are sorry? Sorry for what? Sorry that I made a mistake? That I--~
@1228 = ~Oh, very well! I shall keep my own counsel except for matters of managing my Keep, and perhaps you may regain whatever dignity you feel you may have lost in my bed. I shall never understand this!~
@1229 = ~Now, I believe I have distracted you quite enough with these comforts. We mustn't forget that there are a great many depending on us out there.~
@1230 = ~You and I are very much alike, <CHARNAME>. We have both made our own decisions for so long, I expect neither one of us can truly conceive of our lives being any different.~
@1231 = ~When you were younger, did you ever wonder what it would mean to be an adult? Did you wonder what would happen when you had no one to answer to but your own conscience, and no one to catch you, should you stumble?~
@1232 = ~Pah! I *never* answered to anyone but myself! I didn't need some rite of passage or turn of the calendar to give me that! ~
@1233 = ~I looked forward to it with great anticipation. I wanted so much more than the sheltered, scheduled life of Candlekeep could offer me. I wanted to be free. And I am!~
@1234 = ~I didn't have much time to consider it, Nalia. One day I was a blissful Candlekeep rat. The next, Gorion lay dead at my feet and I had to be strong and independent to survive. No choice.~
@1235 = ~I thought I would be somehow smarter. Taller and stronger, too. I suppose I don't feel much different than I did five or six years ago. I just have more aches and scars.~
@1236 = ~Being an adult doesn't mean you give up guidance or aid, Nalia. We lost our parents, but we still have friends, and more importantly we still have each other.~
@1237 = ~Of course *you* would be so confident. I think it is a fortunate thing that we are not equal in our convictions on some issues.~
@1238 = ~In another, that sort of headstrong attitude would cause me some trepidation. I might even call it reckless... I know aunty would.~
@1239 = ~But I know by now that you wear such attitudes well.~
@1240 = ~Of course. I should have remembered. That Gorion did not prepare you better for what was to come is unfortunate, but your perseverance is a credit to the advantages he obviously gave you in your upbringing.~
@1241 = ~You truly feel no different? Looking back on my own life, I see so little of the girl I once was. Perhaps you are the more fortunate.~
@1242 = ~How true. It is, after all, the way of the world.~
@1243 = ~In one of her gentler moments, Aunty once said to me that I would truly be adult when I had my first real love. I spent some time thinking about this, wondering what she might mean, and when I would have my first love.~
@1244 = ~Naturally, considering her entirely superfluous lectures about duty and responsibility, I presumed she referred to a love of duty. But I had already come to accept and appreciate certain of my responsibilities. I knew that could not be it.~
@1245 = ~I asked Burwood what he thought it meant and he said... well. He said a few things best not repeated in polite company, as he was never very lucky in love, and then he said that love had very little to do with adulthood.~
@1246 = ~I forgot what Delcia said. And I certainly felt that I had known love in my heart, and I knew I was certainly no child.~
@1247 = ~But I know, now, what she meant, <CHARNAME>. Experiencing the new perspectives you bring to my life, seeing the world through clearer eyes, and feeling... feeling something very special and new. For the first time, I understand. She must have been speaking of you.~
@1248 = ~I seriously doubt that Delcia expected me to be your first love. In fact, I imagine she would have chosen anybody but me. ~
@1249 = ~I feel like there is more to this story than you are telling me, Nalia. Surely you have felt love before.~
@1250 = ~And I feel the same, Nalia. You have shown me an entirely new kind of love.~
@1251 = ~Don't let emotions and a little passion fool you, kid. You still have a lot to learn.~
@1252 = ~I can hardly take credit for your composure, Nalia. You have dedication and direction beyond your years. It's part of what makes you so charming.~
@1253 = ~You mustn't let her occasional bouts of disapproval concern you, <CHARNAME>. She does mean well, and for all her bluster, she has never truly stood in the way of anything I wished to do. She just... disapproves. It is who she is.~
@1254 = ~But I didn't bring this up to speak of Aunty.~
@1255 = ~Not... not like this. Not with an equal.~
@1256 = ~And presumably you see it as your place to continue to be my "instructor"? You... you have such unspeakable gall at times, <CHARNAME>!~
@1257 = ~Ever flattering, <CHARNAME>. But it is never unwelcome, I must admit.~
@1258 = ~I believe I shall have to... overlook the implications of that statement just now, <CHARNAME>, lest a misunderstanding cause a terrible scene.~
@1259 = ~I know our lives are not on the path our parents envisioned, or that we could have possibly imagined. There has been so much death, so much brutal unpredictability.~
@1260 = ~It would be a tragedy if life was nothing but saying goodbye to everything that is good, with fewer and fewer to depend on by our side, watching over us.~
@1261 = ~My conscience is clear, <CHARNAME>, but I do not wish to walk the rest of my life alone... not when I have known what life can be. We both know of the suffering out there ready to ensnare the unwary, the alone, the defenseless. And I welcome the thought that neither of us will have to face it alone.~
@1262 = ~You presume a great deal, Nalia. Life is a long series of goodbyes, whether or not you have good intentions or one man or a hundred by your side.~
@1263 = ~I will gladly catch you if you fall, Nalia, if you will do the same for me.~
@1264 = ~I never want to face the darkness alone either. I am glad we have each other.~
@1265 = ~We have both failed to protect those we love before. I love you, but I can never guarantee your safety, nor you mine.~
@1266 = ~Never alone, Nalia. I will make you forget the meaning of the word.~
@1267 = ~That's where you're wrong, <CHARNAME>. The world cares about good intentions. There just are so very few to spare.~
@1268 = ~That, I think, is something that sadly still separates us. I can only strive to set a better example.~
@1269 = ~Of course I will. It's so very clear to me now... I understand now why Aunty was so cryptic.~
@1270 = ~This feeling is not something I can describe, but I know we share it. I know it.~
@1271 = ~We do, don't we? It still seems so strange, how we could ever come together... but I can only think we were somehow linked, somehow ready to make this important change in each other's lives.~
@1272 = ~It's a good feeling, <CHARNAME>, and one I don't plan to give up.~
@1273 = ~Just be there with noble intentions in your heart and openness on your mind. That is all any of us can ever do for the people we care for.~
@1274 = ~I know you will, <CHARNAME>. I know.~
@1275 = ~I have been so busy counting my own good fortunes that it never occurred to me to wonder... how many other debutantes and damsels have been swept from their feet by the Hero of the Sword Coast, as he arrived just in their hour of greatest need?~
@1276 = ~You're my first, Nalia. The only thing I swept before you was my room, and even then only when Gorion yelled.~
@1277 = ~I do not appreciate your insinuation, Nalia. I am not some opportunistic philanderer!~
@1278 = ~Gods know I've tried, but everybody else has been too smart for me. Only you fell for the "I will save you and your kingdom" routine.~
@1279 = ~I would be lying if I said I have not left a legacy of satisfaction and good cheer in my wake, but I assure you, those freewheeling days are behind me.~
@1280 = ~I'm no hero, Nalia. Just a man who does what he has to do for people he cares about.~
@1281 = ~Of course you are, love. But that wasn't what I meant.~
@1282 = ~Oh. I... see. I am glad to hear that, of course. That you consider them behind you, that is, not that you had them at all. Which is to say... which is to say nothing, really.~
@1283 = ~Does that trouble you?~
@1284 = ~What about you? Did you and Isaea--~
@1285 = ~Then let us stop talking about this.~
@1286 = ~Are you asking because I turned you down? I simply don't feel that the time is right.~
@1287 = ~You mean... you couldn't tell? When we were together, I mean.~
@1288 = ~I gave it very little thought, of course. I simply hope you were not drawing any unfair comparisons. I know I certainly did not.~
@1289 = ~All I know is that I would not have traded our time together for anything.~
@1290 = ~Wait, "comparisons"? To who? To what? What are you not telling me?~
@1291 = ~Nalia, I love you, but... can we stop talking about this, please?~
@1292 = ~Good, then neither of us is disappointed. I believe this is the part where we kiss and go about our business.~
@1293 = ~How I love and admire your wisdom sometimes, <CHARNAME>. It's truly an inspiration. Not to mention a lifesaver.~
@1294 = ~No, that was not why I asked. I must say that it only makes me more confused, but... but I don't wish to discuss this any further.~
@1295 = ~<CHARNAME>, please, I meant nothing at all of the sort! You came to me with the best of intentions and if I had cause to doubt them, why... why, we would not be having this conversation at all!~
@1296 = ~I merely wished to know if you had been so... so treasured by another woman before.~
@1297 = ~This is not an open subject, Nalia. Pick another one.~
@1298 = ~No, no one. That was one of the reasons I could not do as you asked at the Keep, Nalia. I was afraid.~
@1299 = ~No, no one. You mean... you couldn't tell?~
@1300 = ~I haven't had time for love, Nalia. It's a wonder that I do even now, but I simply cannot help but love you.~
@1301 = ~I have had other people close to me, yes. Does that trouble you?~
@1302 = ~And indeed I did! You have been true to your word and good conduct, however. Perhaps I have not sprung your dastardly trap?~
@1303 = ~Hah! Aunty must still be waiting for you to spring it, but I think I know you far better.~
@1304 = ~That is a wonderfully quaint image, <CHARNAME>. It gives you character, I think. It shows how far someone can evolve if they are given the right opportunities. Even tragic ones.~
@1305 = ~Do you mean to tell me that there's been no other woman, common or queen, who has invested herself so fully in you?~
@1306 = ~I find that rather difficult to imagine. You are not easy to miss. I certainly didn't.~
@1307 = ~Trouble me? Why, no, of course not. It's all perfectly natural and understandable. It's not as though you wouldn't be attractive to other women. Why would I be troubled by such a thing?~
@1308 = ~I don't know, but you don't seem to be able to stop talking about it. You do, in fact, seem troubled.~
@1309 = ~Just as it would be natural for you to have known other men, of course.~
@1310 = ~I hope you are not. I love you deeply and truly, Nalia. No one else I have known or could ever know can compare.~
@1311 = ~Rumor has it some women experience strong jealousy about such matters.~
@1312 = ~Good, then.~
@1313 = ~Thank you for those kind words. Of course, I did not need to hear them, but they are important to me.~
@1314 = ~You, of course... well. You know already how incomparable and rare you are.~
@1315 = ~No, no, not troubled. Nor surprised. Everything is exactly as it should be, I am quite sure.~
@1316 = ~Think nothing of it. But now tell me this--am I the first strapping young adventurer to find his way into your bed?~
@1317 = ~Think nothing of it. But now tell me this--am I the first strapping young adventurer who has been invited into your bed?~
@1318 = ~Is there something you would like to say to me, Nalia?~
@1319 = ~In truth... yes.~
@1320 = ~Of course some do, but it is such a foolish waste of time when there are so many greater concerns in the world. For someone to expend energy on jealousy is such an irresponsible squandering of precious moments.~
@1321 = ~Good. Then neither of us has any reason to be jealous.~
@1322 = ~Then why are you acting so jealous?~
@1323 = ~Nalia, enough of this. We should love each other, not dwell on past history. Before we fight, let's just kiss and make up now, shall we?~
@1324 = ~And of course, you would not have anything in your past that might make me squander those precious moments.~
@1325 = ~Because... because I am acting very spoiled indeed, aren't I? Oh, what you put up with...~
@1326 = ~Forgive me, my love. My mind wandered to some very unpleasant places. But there are far more important things to tend to, so I would be grateful if you would lead the way.~
@1327 = ~Yes, good. Fine, even.~
@1328 = ~Fine, indeed!~
@1329 = ~I know *exactly* how you feel, <CHARNAME>. Responsibility, tragedy, death, triumph, justice and fairness... it leaves one positively exhausted, mentally and physically.~
@1330 = ~My father warned me of such necessary sacrifices, and I know they played heavily into his decision not to remarry. That, and the court games...~
@1331 = ~...oh, the court games. How glad I am to have you at my side, so that I never need worry about being less than totally honest about my situation and my plans. I'll not dance their dance again!~
@1332 = ~I love you, <CHARNAME>, you wonderful liberating man.~
@1333 = ~Wow. I love you as well.~
@1334 = ~You mean you plan to parade me around in some ballroom? I do not like the sound of that at all.~
@1335 = ~I can't wait to invade your social circles and show a few stuck-up prigs what life is like in the real world.~
@1336 = ~I've been called many things, but never that. Thank you for giving me something new for my journal.~
@1337 = ~As well you should. It is, after all, my noble decree!~
@1338 = ~Well, there will certainly be some necessary affairs of land and state for us to attend to if we are to truly serve our lands as they require. But don't worry about them now. We have plenty of time to find you appropriate attire and training.~
@1339 = ~Far more important things await us today. Let's attend to them.~
@1340 = ~Now, just one moment! Some of these people are good and decent and deserving people who are not the sort to be called names! And... and...~
@1341 = ~...oh, all right, so many of them are prigs. I still think it would be wiser if you left the talking to me. At least, the first time we're at court.~
@1342 = ~Protocol, you understand, my sweet. We'll have lots of time to see you properly educated later.~
@1343 = ~Naturally!~
@1344 = ~Most *certainly not*, <CHARNAME>, and I will thank you to never imagine such a repulsive event again! Ugh, the fantasies that man must have entertained... my skin positively crawled every time he even looked at me. He knew better than to try anything, of course.~
@1345 = ~But that was only part of your question, wasn't it? I suppose I should be fair and tell you that there were... other times.~
@1346 = ~Very well. Pardon my intrusion. I simply wanted to know more about this mysterious man who has become such an important part of my life. It's very foolish, I know.~
@1347 = ~Oh. Was I so very forward? I had hoped to make you comfortable, and avoid any misunderstandings as to my wishes. Things would be so much easier if people heard the true intention of my words!~
@1348 = ~But no matter. I regret making you uncomfortable, <CHARNAME>.~
@1349 = ~I would be less uncomfortable if this conversation were not so one-sided.~
@1350 = ~Of course, <CHARNAME>. You will tell me when you are less unready, of course.~
@1351 = ~Not... not in the way you mean, no.~
@1352 = ~You mean, you wish to hear of my own... background?~
@1353 = ~I gave it very little thought, of course. Comparisons are so unfair. All I know is that I would not have traded our time together for anything.~
@1354 = ~Whew. That's a load off my mind. I was afraid I had disappointed you.~
@1355 = ~But it was never like it is with us. You are my first for love, and by far it was the most wonderful experience I have ever known.~
@1356 = ~To answer your next question, "twice." One was a matter of perfectly natural curiosity, and another was a... a kindness.~
@1357 = ~I knew it! I knew there was something going on between you and Daleson! I'll pull the man's arms off!~
@1358 = ~I don't know that I like the sound of that, Nalia.~
@1359 = ~All right. Forget I asked. I am certainly going to try to.~
@1360 = ~None of that matters to me now. All I want is for us to be together.~
@1361 = ~I feel precisely the same way about all of these matters, <CHARNAME>. What we do together now, and in the future, is worth a thousand of our pasts.~
@1362 = ~I love your clarity of thought. Perhaps that is what first drew me to you...~
@1363 = ~It is not for you to approve or deny, <CHARNAME>. It just is, and I don't think I shall be judged by you for it.~
@1364 = ~I regret bringing up this entire, stupid conversation. Just... just lead the way.~
@1365 = ~I believe I shall try to forget the whole thing as well.~
@1366 = ~I beg your pardon?!? You will do nothing of the sort on my account *or* your own just because you suspect a man of... of anything of this nature.~
@1367 = ~Disappointed? Goodness, no. On the contrary, I find it oddly exhilarating. I don't know if I can explain exactly why... or if I should try.~
@1368 = ~I think I shall simply say that I love you, and leave it at that.~
@1369 = ~Not before I say I love you too!~
@1370 = ~Wait, no, I want more details. Details!~
@1371 = ~Exhilarating? I can handle being exhilarating.~
@1372 = ~How fortunate for me!~
@1373 = ~You're so very cute, <CHARNAME>.~
@1374 = ~I don't have any more to offer you, <CHARNAME>. Let us just leave this subject alone now, please.~
@1375 = ~<CHARNAME>, that is positively adorable!~
@1376 = ~...oh, forgive me. Perhaps saying that did not make things better. But you have been so patient with me... certainly, I can return the favor for you.~
@1377 = ~As you wish, <CHARNAME>. I simply wished to understand you better.~
@1378 = ~<CHARNAME>, do you consider yourself a gambler?~
@1379 = ~Only when I know I can win.~
@1380 = ~I wouldn't say I'm a gambler, but I'll give you a shiny silver piece if you can guess what color I'm thinking of.~
@1381 = ~I do not have time for games of chance. My life is chancy enough.~
@1382 = ~Of course. Gambling is the ultimate expression of courage and nerve. And when I play, I play to win.~
@1383 = ~No, I don't gamble as a matter of principle. Why?~
@1384 = ~That you do, <CHARNAME>. But it seems to me that you have enough accomplishments in your life that you don't need the rather spurious games of chance.~
@1385 = ~Who the hell are you to tell me what I should or shouldn't do?~
@1386 = ~Grant me my moments of pleasure in a difficult life.~
@1387 = ~Gambling keeps my nerves sharp and my instincts honed. It is not just a matter of winning, but of survival.~
@1388 = ~Perhaps you are right, Nalia, but it isn't as though I have squandered your family fortune on the turn of a card, so why the lecture?~
@1389 = ~I understand you, but I think there is another way to look at this.~
@1390 = ~So you see life as a gamble?~
@1391 = ~Yes. One spin of the big wheel at the beginning, and then we play the hand we are dealt. That's a mixed metaphor, but you know what I mean. Fate is a gamble, and fate is what we live and die by.~
@1392 = ~Absolutely. One side bet after another. I bet that if I dodge left my opponent will strike right. I bet I can get this person to help me find Irenicus. I bet I can win the heart of a pretty girl. You know how it is.~
@1393 = ~No, it's not a gamble, but gambling is one headache and one chance I don't have to take, so I'll focus on the ones I do have to take, every day, just to keep us alive.~
@1394 = ~It may be mixed, but it has all the color I have come to expect from you, <CHARNAME>. "One spin of the wheel at the beginning..." But it is not we who bring the stakes to the table. That is, we do not ask to be born. How can we gamble with a gift?~
@1395 = ~That's a very astute observation.~
@1396 = ~Oh, is *that* how it is? I thought it was rather more pure of heart and mind than all that. I think you misinterpret the difference between a gamble and a risk, however.~
@1397 = ~Isn't that what every gambler believes? That he can win any bet he places?~
@1398 = ~Only the foolish ones. Betting, even when you know you're going to lose, tells you about your opponent. It can be a strategic move.~
@1399 = ~You're damn right I can.~
@1400 = ~Games have a way of sorting out those whose confidence is justified and those who are deluding themselves. The strong survive.~
@1401 = ~I suppose you are right. But I cringe to think of an opponent whose weaknesses can only be exposed that way.~
@1402 = ~That is precisely the sort of attitude which makes gambling so dangerous for so many. No one believes they are the weaker player, the one who will suffer when they lose.~
@1403 = ~You are probably thinking of purple. Just to tease me.~
@1404 = ~Damn. You guessed it. Do I really have to pay up? How about double-or-nothing?~
@1405 = ~I was, but not to tease you. It's not every day a Candlekeep boy makes good time with a noblewoman, after all. I just can't get the image out of my head.~
@1406 = ~No, I was thinking of the gorgeous hazel of your eyes, my lovely.~
@1407 = ~I was thinking of inky blackness. I'm afraid my mood tends towards the dismal with all the trouble I have had lately.~
@1408 = ~I wasn't really thinking of a color. Just trying to lighten the mood.~
@1409 = ~I swear, <CHARNAME>, one of these days you will force me to abandon any pretense at conversation and simply melt into your arms with a sigh.~
@1410 = ~But today, I am actually attempting to tell you something important.~
@1411 = ~Oh, I'm not in a somber mood, <CHARNAME>. I am simply sharing an idle thought.~
@1412 = ~I understand. It's hard to know sometimes where our troubles will end. But there's more than enough hope for us, <CHARNAME>. You have to believe in that, even if you feel the odds are against us.~
@1413 = ~Odds... ha, there I go thinking about gambling again.~
@1414 = ~Ah, but you didn't have to gamble to "make good time", did you? I hope you will keep that in mind.~
@1415 = ~I can't say I care much for gambling. And Father absolutely hated it. He saw that it was nothing but a tool to perpetuate poverty at the benefit of a few who controlled the games. But he told me something very important that I shall never forget.~
@1416 = ~"Taking risks is not the same thing as gambling," he told me. Gambling is a chance you take for personal gain. Taking risks is something you do for everyone's good.~
@1417 = ~Some might say that I've gambled my future, getting so close to you. And it's true... I took a big risk when I asked you for your help. But it was the right risk to take, win or lose.~
@1418 = ~And I have come to realize that being together makes both of us better at taking risks--real, meaningful chances, the kind that can make a difference. We have overcome odds together that might have stopped us separately.~
@1419 = ~I don't want to gamble on our future, <CHARNAME>. But I am willing to take any risks necessary in order to see you safe from Irenicus, and anyone else who would harm you.~
@1420 = ~And I would stop at nothing to keep you safe, Nalia. Count on that.~
@1421 = ~How many different ways can I say this? Everything we do is a gamble! There's no amount of frilly words that gets around it!~
@1422 = ~Then I am the luckiest man on Faerun. Thank you for making me such a part of your life.~
@1423 = ~I can think of no one I would rather stand by in good times and in bad. Hopefully I will be able to give you more good times in the near future, once we have sorted out our problems.~
@1424 = ~I know that. You have never failed me this far, and I have every confidence in you still.~
@1425 = ~Please. Never thank me for anything again. I owe you too much for that, and I should find it very tedious to keep accounting for our favors and rescues. Just accept my heartfelt affections.~
@1426 = ~I would like that very much.~
@1427 = ~If I didn't love you so, <CHARNAME>, I might be cross with you for arguing with me at a time like this. But I can overlook it because... because you give me so little choice sometimes.~
@1428 = ~I know that life is mostly what we make it, but never exactly what we want. With you, I think we have the best chance to make it the best it can possibly be.~
@1429 = ~I love that we make each other better. I really believe that together, we want for very little in mind and body.~
@1430 = ~We even have a home, my family’s keep. You have done such a wonderful job as the Lord so far, I’m certain the people would welcome you as a more...permanent fixture.~
@1431 = ~We even have a home, my family’s keep. We will have to make a few changes, I think, such as wiser investments in the long-term welfare of our tenants, but there’s no harm that can’t be undone with some compassion!~
@1432 = ~We really never need be parted at all!~
@1433 = ~Amen to that. I'll be by your side forevermore.~
@1434 = ~I can't promise you anything except that I will endeavor to keep your life exciting. Everything else is a roll of the dice.~
@1435 = ~I'm deliriously happy to hear you say that, Nalia. You are the new bedrock of my life and I could never leave you behind. ~
@1436 = ~Nalia, you should know by now that life is change. Let us live to love another day and consider ourselves lucky at that.~
@1437 = ~I will hold you to that, <CHARNAME>. I will!~
@1438 = ~(sigh) Well, at least I made *part* of my point. That will do, my love.~
@1439 = ~It won't be luck, <CHARNAME>. It won't be luck.~
@1440 = ~This is not some pleasure excursion, child. If <CHARNAME> says any one of us is to remain with the group, it is because you are expected to be useful.~
@1441 = ~Present company included, of course.~ [PGNALI07]
@1442 = ~Of course. <CHARNAME> values my input on matters of the world. Something age and experience outside a gilded shell can bring.~
@1443 = ~Even so, I am glad of the companionship.~
@1444 = ~I do wonder at times when the novelty shall wear off and you will be back among the urchins you adore. Of course, it is always just possible <CHARNAME> intends to attend some hideous social function and needs his collar properly turned for the occasion.~
@1445 = ~We *can* count on you to at least get that right, can't we?~
@1446 = ~I would not say my ability to navigate polite company is my strongest asset to the group, but it is certainly clear enough that it is one he cannot expect from all quarters.~ [PGNALI08]
@1447 = ~I have no time or respect to spare for the inferior. That is what makes me a survivor instead of a victim.~
@1448 = ~It also makes you such a joy to be around.~
@1449 = ~Oh, well, I... I'm not too tired to continue, <CHARNAME>. If you need.~
@1450 = ~Is that so, Aerie? That's not what I thought I overheard you say just a moment ago...~ [PGNALI10]
@1451 = ~Then I think you misheard me, Nalia. I... I wouldn't want to hold up the group.~
@1452 = ~Yes, well... we seem to have set camp, so it doesn't much matter now.~
@1453 = ~Must you be reminded again that this is not a country picnic? If you are not ready to fight for your life and ours at any moment, what exactly do you hope to accomplish here?~
@1454 = ~It's a figure of speech, Jaheira. Must you be so ready to dissect everything we say? I hardly think carving me to ribbons will improve the taste of our evening stew, in any case.~ [PGNALI11]
@1455 = ~What you call "carving" I call common sense. Something not all of us have in abundance.~
@1456 = ~What about common courtesy? Such as the type that would allow me to finish my discussion with <CHARNAME> uninterrupted.~
@1457 = ~"Nalia," he would say, "you're just as tiresome and plain as ever."~
@1458 = ~Not that you need a reason, but is there any particular occasion for this abuse?~ [PGNALI12]
@1459 = ~Only your insufferable irrelevance, and mistaken assumption that anybody cares.~
@1460 = ~I care. And I, for one, will let <CHARNAME> decide whether or not he cares. As I was saying...~
@1461 = ~I don't feel that anyone should have to suffer, Nalia, but you... you seem to expect him to rescue you every time you call. Like you're entitled.~
@1462 = ~I don't think I'm entitled to anything special due to who I am, if that's what you're implying, Aerie. And I think I have made it quite clear that I appreciate everything this group has done for me.~ [PGNALI18]
@1463 = ~Maybe it's just the way you say these things. It sounds like... like you think that anything that happens to you should be an inconvenience for everyone.~
@1464 = ~Aerie, I have said nothing of the kind! If you would let me finish, I will be thanking <CHARNAME> once again about my recent... propensity towards needing rescue.~
@1465 = ~Hmmm. It does betray your painfully obvious dependence on the strong.~
@1466 = ~It is clear to me why you are so fascinated with the feeble in your society. They are your true peers.~
@1467 = ~I am not feeble or helpless! I simply have been placed in situations lately where I greatly benefited from a helping hand.~ [PGNALI19]
@1468 = ~Nothing you can relate to, of course, as I am sure your cries for rescue were just a formality before you sprang yourself from the stake.~
@1469 = ~Silence, elg'caress! Were it not for human treachery, I would have had no need for deliverance from the hands of the idol-worshipping iblith!~
@1470 = ~And were it not for drow vulgarities, I would be completing my discussion with <CHARNAME> about my recent... propensity towards needing rescue.~
@1471 = ~A pity you did not stay there. We might have been spared your painfully inept attempts to impress <CHARNAME>.~
@1472 = ~And I suppose you believe that your constant rain of barbs at any moving target is currying favor? It's no secret that you are a vicious, territorial creature, Viconia. And I hardly believe anyone would want to get closer to someone so indiscriminately venomous.~ [PGNALI24]
@1473 = ~I could explain it to you, but it would take so long. And I might even feel guilty, despoiling your virgin ears.~
@1474 = ~I don't think there is a single thing you could teach me that I would want to know.~
@1475 = ~I do hope you heard that, <CHARNAME>.~
@1476 = ~And I hope you will kindly let him hear the rest of my thoughts.~
@1477 = ~Again? Just because you're well-traveled doesn't mean he wants to hear you boast about it. Some of us didn't have your wonderful, comfortable opportunities in life, Nalia.~
@1478 = ~I have never denied that I have been granted some unique opportunities, but life is what you make of it given your circumstances, Aerie. Why are you so upset about my story?~ [PGNALI25]
@1479 = ~I... I'm just saying that bragging isn't becoming. Or necessary. It's just a way to get ahead of other people and make them feel small.~
@1480 = ~You say that as though we are in competition for something. I assure you, there's absolutely no competition here, Aerie. I am merely telling a story.~
@1481 = ~A-and we all have to listen to it! Listen to how fabulously cultured and wealthy you are and how you know best what to do for everybody with any problem anywhere!~
@1482 = ~Well. I didn't realize you felt so strongly about Memnon, Aerie. I never meant to cause you so much additional grief.~
@1483 = ~Perhaps you will turn away, then, and let my words only reach <CHARNAME>'s ears.~
@1484 = ~Does your audacity know no bounds, Nalia? You step outside after living a fairy tale life and now you believe you know how to right all of society's ills.~
@1485 = ~Perhaps if you climb off your pedestal, you will see that the real world is a complicated and dangerous place, and that balance and compromise are necessary things.~
@1486 = ~My life has not been a fairy tale, Jaheira. I lost everyone who ever cared for me, violently, and that has *not* been easy!~ [PGNALI28]
@1487 = ~I would have thought you would be more sensitive to that, since you lost the only man who could ever care for you!~
@1488 = ~Do not bring Khalid into this! His suffering was bad enough without being used as a weapon in the mouth of a deluded debutante!~
@1489 = ~Better deluded than domineering.~
@1490 = ~What did you say?~
@1491 = ~I don't have *anything* more to say to you, Jaheira.~
@1492 = ~Speak for yourself, sister. If <CHARNAME> had waited any longer, he was gonna get an earful.~
@1493 = ~I meant no disrespect, Imoen. Of course I'm glad you're safe. I was simply looking at the bigger picture.~
@1494 = ~Good. Now that you have realized this, perhaps you would deign to leave him in peace. These constant, aimless barrages benefit nobody.~
@1495 = ~What a curious coincidence, because nobody asked for your opinion, Jaheira.~ [PGNALI30]
@1496 = ~I suppose you feel I'm driving a wedge into whatever plan you have to take over <CHARNAME>'s life, but I was taught to be honest, and so I cannot say I'm sorry.~
@1497 = ~My relationship with <CHARNAME> is none of your concern. When I see his time and energies being frittered away by some foolish girl whose heart is bigger than her head, I am well within my rights to speak.~
@1498 = ~Frittered away? It's nothing but talk! Although I see how agitated you are by the thought there might be something more to it. Why don't you just get everything you want to say to <CHARNAME> out now, Jaheira, and save us all from these ridiculous outbursts?~
@1499 = ~Ridiculous. <CHARNAME>, this girl clearly has a strong fixation with you which clouds all judgment. I think you should clear the air, now, before any further misunderstandings occur.~
@1500 = ~The only misunderstanding here is as to which of us is dubiously pursuing him.~
@1501 = ~I can't listen to another word. Jaheira, I will talk to Nalia whenever and about whatever I choose.~
@1502 = ~Nalia's right, Jaheira. You make me uncomfortable, the way you circle me like a hawk. Give me some room before I suffocate!~
@1503 = ~Jaheira has a point, Nalia. You have been rather clingy. I don't appreciate that.~
@1504 = ~Everything Nalia says to me goes in one ear and out the other, but I will take your word for it. Whatever you have, Nalia, I don't want it.~
@1505 = ~That is your right, of course. Do as you please. In the long run, it means nothing.~
@1506 = ~Very well. Breathe deeply of her oversweet perfume, then. I have no more to say about this.~
@1507 = ~Clingy, am I? I simply try to show some heartfelt, human gratitude and emotion, and that is how you dismiss me? Fine!~
@1508 = ~If you are so insensitive, then there is absolutely nothing I have that I would give to you.~
@1509 = ~My. I never intended to make such a scene. I simply wished to tell you that you need not be so concerned with my questions.~
@1510 = ~How can you be so transparently lascivious? Do they not have any sense of pride or decency where you come from?~
@1511 = ~Where I come from, women are free to speak their minds, especially about what pleases or displeases them. And we have no tolerance for tiresome prudes who interrupt when their betters are talking.~
@1512 = ~And the men? How are they treated?~
@1513 = ~That, waela, is for me to know and for <CHARNAME> to find out.~
@1514 = ~Mmmmm. Yes. There is definite potential here.~
@1515 = ~That is hardly surprising. You have brought nothing of value or worth to this society. What comfort can a priestess of suffering and foul torture bring to the already-suffering masses?~
@1516 = ~It is interruptions like these which remind me just how delinquent I have been of late in inflicting "suffering and foul torture.~
@1517 = ~You don't frighten me, Viconia.~
@1518 = ~I know. Such a pity for you. Now go pout over there while I finish my conversation with <CHARNAME>.~
@1519 = ~I agree with Nalia. Why should we care what you think of us when drow bring us nothing but suffering?~
@1520 = ~Your behavior has been unconscionable. <CHARNAME> deserves far better than to be assailed by someone whose life was saved through generosity when others wouldn't spit to save her!~
@1521 = ~Oh, Nalia. You poor, bedraggled heiress. Do you really believe these outbursts give a rosy glow to your homely features? Kindly count out your tithes to beggars and leave the adults to their discussion.~
@1522 = ~I will not be ordered around by the likes of you! And I will certainly not endorse your complete lack of manners!~
@1523 = ~Had you the first ounce of decency, you would never treat him in this manner.~
@1524 = ~If you believe you owe him bootlicking devotion for your own deliverance, then by all means, lavish him with your pathetic fealty. Lap the scum from his heels for all the good it will do you. I will watch, and laugh.~
@1525 = ~Can you even hear yourself? How could one possibly believe an apology from a vicious interloper whose thoughts so quickly turn to hurtful disdain? You'll only do it again, and again, and again! You're a bully, Viconia, plain and simple. A tarted-up, shameless bully.~
@1526 = ~Better that my mind be full of disdain than completely empty. Come back when you have something interesting to say. I know <CHARNAME> has more than enough between his ears to understand me when I say that I regret my earlier words to him... and I regret little.~
@1527 = ~Enough! I cannot bear a single moment more of this!~
@1528 = ~Forgive me, <CHARNAME>, I have tried to keep my opinions to myself, but Viconia is such a manipulative... such a conniving... so utterly without... she is such a cruel bitch that I would be doing you a disservice to keep my mouth closed.~
@1529 = ~There is simply nothing more you can or should say to him. You proved long ago what you are and how you like to treat people. Go find another victim.~
@1530 = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>, this is truly priceless. You have your very own attack dog. More of a mangy cur than a true warbeast, but we take what we can get.~
@1531 = ~See how she snaps and growls when she perceives her territory is threatened? More, Nalia, I implore you. Will you fetch? Roll over? Thump your leg when scratched behind the ear?~
@1532 = ~Say what you will, Viconia. All you're doing is proving exactly what kind of person you are. Your vindictive cruelty speaks for itself.~
@1533 = ~Elg'caress, your jealous outbursts are just another way you malodorously heat the air we breathe. <CHARNAME> has no need of a snapping attack dog when he has a real woman by his side.~
@1534 = ~<CHARNAME>, please! Please tell her that her conduct has been entirely inappropriate and that you will stand for it no longer!~
@1535 = ~Yes, dear <CHARNAME>. Do tell me what you think of all this. Am I so utterly repugnant to you? This misguided girl seems to believe you can't handle the occasional disagreement without her yapping at my heels. I know you are made of far stronger stuff.~
@1536 = ~I'll do as I like with Viconia, Nalia. Back off.~
@1537 = ~I appreciate your concern, Nalia, but I believe Viconia and I understand one another better than you know.~
@1538 = ~I think she has a point, Viconia. Perhaps it is best if we simply keep our relationship professional. Fewer hurt feelings that way.~
@1539 = ~She's right, Viconia. You are an unstoppable bitch and I don't want to hear another word from you.~
@1540 = ~You would stoop so low as to let this poodle emasculate you? Pah! My skin crawls at the mere thought of your weakness, iblith!~
@1541 = ~Obviously you have not heard a single word either of us has said. No matter. I will not waste any more time thinking of such things.~
@1542 = ~You understand? You mean, you plan to let this continue? Obviously you see something far different in Viconia than I do. And it is certainly nothing I care to emulate.~
@1543 = ~<CHARNAME>, is she always like this? Always second-guessing you, saying you should go left immediately after you decide to go right?~
@1544 = ~If you have something to say, Nalia, you may address me directly. I am standing right here.~
@1545 = ~Yes, I know you are, but my question was for <CHARNAME>.~
@1546 = ~Then kindly ask it on your own time if it is so important. I would speak to him now, uninterrupted.~
@1547 = ~I was not making demands or administering correction. Merely musing about what my life has been, or could have been.~
@1548 = ~You worry incessantly. Especially about every little thing he does. It is quite clear to some of us that our situation is well in-hand and being ably managed. You, on the other hand, do little but share your doubts about any decision!~
@1549 = ~What have I done to earn this derision from you, Nalia?~
@1550 = ~It is your complete lack of discretion which bothers me, Jaheira. It seems that no time is the wrong time to assail <CHARNAME> with one of your concerns, when it is apparent that he is doing his best to tend to many problems at once.~
@1551 = ~I have no patience or time to indulge whatever agenda you are pursuing, Nalia. If my concerns are incompatible with yours, expect no apologies.~
@1552 = ~Aerie!~
@1553 = ~What?~
@1554 = ~Don't you understand what an impossible question that is for <CHARNAME>? How can he possibly answer with any sort of honesty, for fear of breaking your little heart?~
@1555 = ~He... it was simply a question, Nalia! Why shouldn't I ask his opinion?~
@1556 = ~Aerie, there are some things we simply must deal with on our own. He cannot change how you feel about your wings, and it is very unfair to ask him to try.~
@1557 = ~I guess I'll have to beg your pardon if I wasn't bred to ask these questions in just the proper way!~
@1558 = ~Nalia's right. You should forget about them and move on.~
@1559 = ~Aerie, it would truly do you a world of good to appreciate that a certain amount of unpleasantness is the lot of every station in life. Do something about the working conditions of circus performers if you are so concerned. Simply lamenting these bad times accomplishes nothing.~
@1560 = ~I was only trying to talk to a friend about traveling. Obviously that isn't you.~
@1561 = ~Oh, Aerie, don't be like that. I simply want to help you be more effective in expressing yourself, without wasting <CHARNAME>'s time.~
@1562 = ~I... I think I know *exactly* what you want to do. And all I want to do is hear about your travels, <CHARNAME>.~
@1563 = ~Now, really, Aerie, that is quite enough. These ploys for sympathy are wholly unbecoming and entirely unnecessary. I don't think you realize just how demeaning this sort of thing is, or how embarrassing it is for the rest of us!~
@1564 = ~Ploys for sympathy? How can you say such a thing? I'm not the one who... who picked him up in a seedy bar, while crying for help! And who never misses an opportunity to remind him of everything she lost in her palace!~
@1565 = ~I was *not* crying! And that is hardly the same thing! Many lives were at stake then! You, Aerie... this is simple manipulation, and it's an insult to <CHARNAME>, asking him to give your life some meaning lest you throw it away.~
@1566 = ~If you can't use your abilities to help <CHARNAME> and help others because you can't see past the scars on... of your past, then that's your own concern.~
@1567 = ~I don't have to listen to this! I don't! You're just as bad as anybody, Nalia, and it's arguments like this that make this awful earthbound life so terrible!~
@1568 = ~I can't live like this anymore! I can't!~
@1569 = ~This is preposterous! How often must you waste our time with this self-pity which never goes anywhere, and certainly never leads to anything except another grasping reach for his attentions?~
@1570 = ~Shut up, Nalia! Just shut up! You think you're the only person allowed to have problems, don't you? That we... we all have to show deference to the queen when she airs her grievances? Well, you're not the only person in the world, Nalia! You're not!~
@1571 = ~Aerie, my dear, you know I have great respect for the suffering of others, it's just that--~
@1572 = ~Oh, save it! This needling is about one thing and one thing only. You can't stand to see <CHARNAME> pay attention to anybody but you!~
@1573 = ~You want him at your beck and call to pull you out of every little scrape, but it just eats you up inside to see him give the slightest care to someone else who might need him!~
@1574 = ~I'm quite sure <CHARNAME> doesn't need someone who threatens to die on him every time she's a little disappointed, Aerie. That is unfair and manipulative and, if I do say so, more than a little immature. Particularly for someone who seems to think she is his lover.~
@1575 = ~Immature? Immature?!? Coming from someone who doesn't know the first thing about living in the real world, I... I find that laughable, Nalia! Just laughable!~
@1576 = ~I will *not* be laughed at!~
@1577 = ~<CHARNAME>, I think it is long past time Aerie heard this from you. Don't you think this is all needlessly dramatic and not in the least bit appropriate?~
@1578 = ~The only thing inappropriate is how you have treated Aerie, Nalia. I think it's disgusting and it stops, right here.~
@1579 = ~Aerie is my friend and she is welcome to talk to me any time she wants.~
@1580 = ~Shhh, Nalia, you're ruining it! I love it when Aerie moans about her wings and wanting to die! It's hysterical!~
@1581 = ~Aerie, Nalia is right. Whatever it is you want to hear, I don't think you should come to me for it anymore.~
@1582 = ~I was only trying to look out for your best interests, <CHARNAME>! But I... I see how you want it. Very well.~
@1583 = ~Is that what you think? I don't think this is a very healthy friendship, <CHARNAME>. But if those are your wishes, then please, indulge yourself.~
@1584 = ~Is... is that all I am? Some kind of joke to you? I won't be made a fool of for your entertainment!~
@1585 = ~Y-you would just turn me aside like this? For her? You're not the man I thought you were, <CHARNAME>. I feel... oh, never mind.~
@1586 = ~I am simply honoring a commitment, lest you chase your own tail off the edge of a cliff.~
@1587 = ~Well. It's a good thing SOMEBODY appreciates what I suffered trying to make sure <CHARNAME> wasn't half as boring as those monks.~
@1588 = ~Spare some coin for a sailor whose ship left 'im fer dead?~
@1589 = ~How terrible! Of course I can help you. Here are five gold pieces.~
@1590 = ~Now, don't spend them all in one place!~
@1591 = ~Oh, rest assured, gir--uh, that is, yer Ladyship, I'll make 'em last.~
@1592 = ~Heh heh.~
@1593 = ~Shhh! Could you possibly be more indelicate?~
@1594 = ~Really, <CHARNAME>. *This* is the best you can do?~
@1595 = ~Are you two blushing? You are! Shame, shame! Minsc and Boo know your names!~
@1596 = ~Well. That was far more than I ever wished to know about your personal lives.~
@1597 = ~What, her? Ye've nothin' ta hold onto, man! Pfagh!~
@1598 = ~Of course. After investing one of the most powerful bloodlines in history in such an inferior shell, all he could do for an encore was rut with an empty-headed thrillseeker. Go. Fulfill your great destiny already.~
@1599 = ~Yeah. I'm afraid some of us in the back didn't quite hear you, <CHARNAME>. Would you mind shouting that again?~
@1600 = ~No! No I most certainly do not wish to do anything of the sort! Just forget it!~
